				<ANSWER answerid="Q1-S1-A1" pairid="1">Cardiac amyloidosis is a disorder caused by deposits of an abnormal protein (amyloid) in the heart tissue. These deposits make it hard for the heart to work properly.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q1-S1-A2" pairid="2">The term "amyloidosis" refers not to a single disease but to a collection of diseases in which a protein-based infiltrate deposits in tissues as beta-pleated sheets. The subtype of the disease is determined by which protein is depositing; although dozens of subtypes have been described, most are incredibly rare or of trivial importance. This analysis will focus on the main systemic forms of amyloidosis, both of which frequently involve the heart.</ANSWER>

	<SUBJECT>treatment options versus migraine types</SUBJECT>
	<MESSAGE>Migraine seems to be a spectrum of conditions rather than only one easily diagnosed affliction.  Many innovative migraine treatments are now in use, but it seems that each treatment only addresses a narrow set of conditions; for example, my daughter has tried many different treatment options (QEEG, HEG, TMS, topamax, ...) without success.  Has any research been done to characterize which treatment types are effective against which migraine types?</MESSAGE>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q2-S1-A1" pairid="3">There is no specific cure for migraine headaches. The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away, and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers.   A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your doctor can plan how to avoid these triggers.  If you have frequent migraines, your doctor may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include:  - Antidepressants  - Blood pressure medicines  - Seizure medicines    Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month.  Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your doctor to see if riboflavin or magnesium are right for you.  TREATING AN ATTACK  Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that:   - Taking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine.  - Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver.  - Too much ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or kidneys.    If these treatments do not help, ask your doctor about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections.   Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your doctor before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.  Other medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other drugs that treat the migraine itself.   Feverfew is a herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people. Before using feverfew, make sure your doctor approves. Herbal remedies sold in drugstores and health food stores are not regulated. Work with a trained herbalist when selecting herbs.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q2-S1-A2" pairid="4">There is no absolute cure for migraine since its pathophysiology has yet to be fully understood.  There are two ways to approach the treatment of migraine headache with drugs: prevent the attacks, or relieve the symptoms during the attacks. Prevention involves the use of medications and behavioral changes.  Drugs originally developed for epilepsy, depression, or high blood pressure to prevent future attacks have been shown to be extremely effective in treating migraine. Botulinum toxin A has been shown to be effective in prevention of chronic migraine.  Behaviorally, stress management strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, biofeedback mechanisms, and other therapies designed to limit daily discomfort, may reduce the number and severity of migraine attacks.  Making a log of personal triggers of migraine can also provide useful information for trigger-avoiding lifestyle changes, including dietary considerations, eating regularly scheduled meals with adequate hydration, stopping certain medications, and establishing a consistent sleep schedule. Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle. A weight loss program is recommended for obese individuals with migraine.                  Relief of symptoms, or acute treatments, during attacks consists of sumatriptan, ergotamine drugs, and analgesics such as ibuprofen and aspirin.  The sooner these treatments are administered, the more effective they are.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q6-S1-A1" pairid="8">Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone. This condition is often called underactive thyroid.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q6-S1-A2" pairid="9">Summary       Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, just above your collarbone. It is one of your endocrine glands, which make hormones. Thyroid hormones control the rate of many activities in your body. These include how fast you burn calories and how fast your heart beats. All of these activities are your body&apos;s metabolism. If your thyroid gland is not active enough, it does not make enough thyroid hormone to meet your body&apos;s needs. This condition is hypothyroidism.    Hypothyroidism is more common in women, people with other thyroid problems, and those over 60 years old. Hashimoto&apos;s disease, an autoimmune disorder, is the most common cause. Other causes include thyroid nodules, thyroiditis, congenital hypothyroidism, surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid, radiation treatment of the thyroid, and some medicines.    The symptoms can vary from person to person. They may include       - Fatigue    - Weight gain    - A puffy face    - Cold intolerance    - Joint and muscle pain    - Constipation    - Dry skin    - Dry, thinning hair    - Decreased sweating    - Heavy or irregular menstrual periods and fertility problems    - Depression    - Slowed heart rate       To diagnose hypothyroidism, your doctor will look at your symptoms and blood tests. Treatment is with synthetic thyroid hormone, taken every day.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q6-S1-A3" pairid="10">Hypothyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone to meet the body’s needs.  Thyroid hormone regulates metabolism—the way the body uses energy—and affects nearly every organ in the body. Without enough thyroid hormone, many of the body’s functions slow down.  About 4.6 percent of the U.S. population age 12 and older has hypothyroidism.1</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q6-S2-A1" pairid="12">The thyroid gland is an important organ of the endocrine system. It is located at the front of the neck, just above where your collarbones meet. The thyroid makes hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called metabolism.   Hypothyroidism is more common in women and people over age 50.  The most common cause of hypothyroidism is thyroiditis. Swelling and inflammation damage the thyroid gland&apos;s cells.   Causes of this problem include:   - The immune system attacking the thyroid gland  - Viral infections (common cold) or other respiratory infections  - Pregnancy (often called postpartum thyroiditis)    Other causes of hypothyroidism include:  - Certain medicines, such as lithium and amiodarone  - Congenital (birth) defects  - Radiation treatments to the neck or brain to treat different cancers  - Radioactive iodine used to treat an overactive thyroid gland  - Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland  - Sheehan syndrome, a condition that may occur in a woman who bleeds severely during pregnancy or childbirth and causes the destruction of the pituitary gland  - Pituitary tumor or pituitary surgery</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q6-S2-A2" pairid="13">Hypothyroidism has several causes, including                  - Hashimoto’s disease  - thyroiditis, or inflammation of the thyroid  - congenital hypothyroidism, or hypothyroidism that is present at birth  - surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid  - radiation treatment of the thyroid  - some medications                  Less commonly, hypothyroidism is caused by too much or too little iodine in the diet or by abnormalities of the pituitary gland.                  Hashimoto’s Disease                  Hashimoto’s disease, also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States.1  Hashimoto’s disease is a form of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland.  Hashimoto’s disease is also an autoimmune disorder.                  Normally, the immune system protects the body against foreign invaders—such as viruses and bacteria—that can cause illness.  But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the body’s own cells and organs.  With Hashimoto’s disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid, causing inflammation and interfering with its ability to produce thyroid hormones.                  More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Hashimoto’s Disease.                  Thyroiditis                  Thyroiditis causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of the thyroid gland.  At first, the leakage raises hormone levels in the blood, leading to hyperthyroidism—when thyroid hormone levels are too high––that lasts for 1 or 2 months.  Most people then develop hypothyroidism before the thyroid is completely healed.                  Several types of thyroiditis can cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism:                  - Subacute thyroiditis. This condition involves painful inflammation and enlargement of the thyroid.  Experts are not sure what causes subacute thyroiditis, but it may be related to a viral or bacterial infection.  The condition usually goes away on its own in a few months.  - Postpartum thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis develops after a woman gives birth.  For more information, see the section titled “What happens with pregnancy and thyroid conditions?”  - Silent thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis is called “silent” because it is painless, as is postpartum thyroiditis, even though the thyroid may be enlarged.  Like postpartum thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis is probably an autoimmune condition and sometimes develops into permanent hypothyroidism.                  Congenital Hypothyroidism                  Some babies are born with a thyroid that is not fully developed or does not function properly.  If untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to mental retardation and growth failure.  Early treatment can prevent these complications, so most newborns in the United States are screened for hypothyroidism.                  Surgical Removal of the Thyroid                  When part of the thyroid is removed, the remaining part may produce normal amounts of thyroid hormone, but some people who have this surgery develop hypothyroidism.  Removal of the entire thyroid always results in hypothyroidism.                  Part or all of the thyroid may be surgically removed as a treatment for                  - hyperthyroidism  - a large goiter, which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to appear swollen and can interfere with normal breathing and swallowing  - thyroid nodules, which are noncancerous tumors, called adenomas, or lumps in the thyroid that can produce excess thyroid hormone  - thyroid cancer                  Radiation Treatment of the Thyroid                  Radioactive iodine, a common treatment for hyperthyroidism, gradually destroys the cells of the thyroid.  Most people who receive radioactive iodine treatment eventually develop hypothyroidism.  People with Hodgkin’s disease, other lymphomas, and head or neck cancers are treated with radiation, which can also damage the thyroid.                  Medications                  Some drugs can interfere with thyroid hormone production and lead to hypothyroidism, including                  - amiodarone, a heart medication  - interferon alpha, a cancer medication  - lithium, a bipolar disorder medication  - interleukin-2, a kidney cancer medication</ANSWER>

You will need a doctor to thoroughly clean the wound and remove any foreign objects. Most of the time, stitches should not be used for animal bite wounds.  If there is any risk of rabies, you will be given a series of a preventive vaccine. The vaccine is generally given in 5 doses over 28 days.  Most patients also receive a treatment called human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG). This treatment is given the day the bite occurred.  Call your doctor right away after an animal bite or after being exposed to animals such as bats, foxes, and skunks. They may carry rabies.  - Call even when no bite took place.  - Immunization and treatment for possible rabies are recommended for at least up to 14 days after exposure or a bite.    There is no known effective treatment for people with symptoms of a rabies infection, but there have been a few reports of people surviving with experimental treatments.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q9-S1-A1" pairid="16">X-linked congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness). They also have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), severe nearsightedness (high myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Color vision is typically not affected by this disorder. The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Researchers have identified two major types of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness: the complete form and the incomplete form. The types have very similar signs and symptoms. However, everyone with the complete form has night blindness, while not all people with the incomplete form have night blindness. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause and by the results of a test called an electroretinogram, which measures the function of the retina.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q10-S1-A1" pairid="17">Summary       Lewy body disease is one of the most common causes of dementia in the elderly. Dementia is the loss of mental functions severe enough to affect normal activities and relationships. Lewy body disease happens when abnormal structures, called Lewy bodies, build up in areas of the brain. The disease may cause a wide range of symptoms, including       - Changes in alertness and attention    - Hallucinations    - Problems with movement and posture    - Muscle stiffness    - Confusion    - Loss of memory       Lewy body disease can be hard to diagnose, because Parkinson&apos;s disease and Alzheimer&apos;s disease cause similar symptoms. Scientists think that Lewy body disease might be related to these diseases, or that they sometimes happen together.    Lewy body disease usually begins between the ages of 50 and 85. The disease gets worse over time. There is no cure. Treatment focuses on drugs to help symptoms.     NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q10-S1-A2" pairid="18">Lewy body dementia is one of the most common forms of progressive dementia. People affected by this condition may experience a variety of symptoms such as changes in alertness and attention; hallucinations; problems with movement and posture; muscle stiffness; confusion; and/or memory loss. Although the exact cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood, symptoms are thought to result when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein (&quot;Lewy bodies&quot;) accumulate in the brain. Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Rarely, more than one family member may be affected. There is currently no cure for Lewy body dementia; however, medications may be available to help manage the associated symptoms.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q11-S1-A1" pairid="19">Mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes can cause maple syrup urine disease. These three genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together as a complex. The protein complex is essential for breaking down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which are present in many kinds of food, particularly protein-rich foods such as milk, meat, and eggs.    Mutations in any of these three genes reduce or eliminate the function of the protein complex, preventing the normal breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their byproducts build up in the body. Because high levels of these substances are toxic to the brain and other organs, their accumulation leads to the serious health problems associated with maple syrup urine disease.</ANSWER>

Fluids, sugars, and sometimes fats are given through a vein (IV). Dialysis through your belly or a vein can be done to reduce the level of abnormal substances in your blood.  Long-term treatment requires a special diet. For infants, the diet includes a formula with low levels of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. People with this condition must remain on a diet low in these amino acids for life.  It is very important to always follow this diet to prevent nervous system (neurological) damage. This requires frequent blood tests and close supervision by a registered dietitian and physician, as well as cooperation by parents of children with the condition.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q14-S1-A1" pairid="25">Lifestyle changes often can help relieve acute (short-term) insomnia. These changes might make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.                  A type of counseling called cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help relieve the anxiety linked to chronic (ongoing) insomnia. Anxiety tends to prolong insomnia.                  Several medicines also can help relieve insomnia and re-establish a regular sleep schedule. However, if your insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem, it&apos;s important to treat the underlying cause (if possible).                  Lifestyle Changes                  If you have insomnia, avoid substances that make it worse, such as:                  Caffeine, tobacco, and other stimulants. The effects of these substances can last as long as 8 hours.                  Certain over-the-counter and prescription medicines that can disrupt sleep (for example, some cold and allergy medicines). Talk with your doctor about which medicines won&apos;t disrupt your sleep.                  Alcohol. An alcoholic drink before bedtime might make it easier for you to fall asleep. However, alcohol triggers sleep that tends to be lighter than normal. This makes it more likely that you will wake up during the night.                  Try to adopt bedtime habits that make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Follow a routine that helps you wind down and relax before bed. For example, read a book, listen to soothing music, or take a hot bath.                  Try to schedule your daily exercise at least 5 to 6 hours before going to bed. Don&apos;t eat heavy meals or drink a lot before bedtime.                  Make your bedroom sleep-friendly. Avoid bright lighting while winding down. Try to limit possible distractions, such as a TV, computer, or pet. Make sure the temperature of your bedroom is cool and comfortable. Your bedroom also should be dark and quiet.                  Go to sleep around the same time each night and wake up around the same time each morning, even on weekends. If you can, avoid night shifts, alternating schedules, or other things that may disrupt your sleep schedule.                  Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy                  CBT for insomnia targets the thoughts and actions that can disrupt sleep. This therapy encourages good sleep habits and uses several methods to relieve sleep anxiety.                  For example, relaxation techniques and biofeedback are used to reduce anxiety. These strategies help you better control your breathing, heart rate, muscles, and mood.                  CBT also aims to replace sleep anxiety with more positive thinking that links being in bed with being asleep. This method also teaches you what to do if you&apos;re unable to fall asleep within a reasonable time.                  CBT also may involve talking with a therapist one-on-one or in group sessions to help you consider your thoughts and feelings about sleep. This method may encourage you to describe thoughts racing through your mind in terms of how they look, feel, and sound. The goal is for your mind to settle down and stop racing.                  CBT also focuses on limiting the time you spend in bed while awake. This method involves setting a sleep schedule. At first, you will limit your total time in bed to the typical short length of time you&apos;re usually asleep.                  This schedule might make you even more tired because some of the allotted time in bed will be taken up by problems falling asleep. However, the resulting tiredness is intended to help you get to sleep more quickly. Over time, the length of time spent in bed is increased until you get a full night of sleep.                  For success with CBT, you may need to see a therapist who is skilled in this approach weekly over 2 to 3 months. CBT works as well as prescription medicine for many people who have chronic insomnia. It also may provide better long-term relief than medicine alone.                  For people who have insomnia and major depressive disorder, CBT combined with antidepression medicines has shown promise in relieving both conditions.                  Medicines                  Prescription Medicines                  Many prescription medicines are used to treat insomnia. Some are meant for short-term use, while others are meant for longer use.                  Talk to your doctor about the benefits and side effects of insomnia medicines. For example, insomnia medicines can help you fall asleep, but you may feel groggy in the morning after taking them.                  Rare side effects of these medicines include sleep eating, sleep walking, or driving while asleep. If you have side effects from an insomnia medicine, or if it doesn&apos;t work well, tell your doctor. He or she might prescribe a different medicine.                  Some insomnia medicines can be habit forming. Ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of insomnia medicines.                  Over-the-Counter Products                  Some over-the-counter (OTC) products claim to treat insomnia. These products include melatonin, L-tryptophan supplements, and valerian teas or extracts.                  The Food and Drug Administration doesn&apos;t regulate “natural” products and some food supplements. Thus, the dose and purity of these substances can vary. How well these products work and how safe they are isn&apos;t well understood.                  Some OTC products that contain antihistamines are sold as sleep aids. Although these products might make you sleepy, talk to your doctor before taking them.                  Antihistamines pose risks for some people. Also, these products may not offer the best treatment for your insomnia. Your doctor can advise you whether these products will benefit you.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q15-S1-A2" pairid="27">Summary       Diabetes insipidus (DI) causes frequent urination. You become extremely thirsty, so you drink. Then you urinate. This cycle can keep you from sleeping or even make you wet the bed. Your body produces lots of urine that is almost all water.    DI is different from diabetes mellitus (DM), which involves insulin problems and high blood sugar. The symptoms can be similar. However, DI is related to how your kidneys handle fluids. It&apos;s much less common than DM. Urine and blood tests can show which one you have.    Usually, DI is caused by a problem with your pituitary gland or your kidneys. Treatment depends on the cause of the problem. Medicines can often help.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q15-S1-A3" pairid="30">Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare disease that causes frequent urination. The large volume of urine is diluted, mostly water. To make up for lost water, a person with DI may feel the need to drink large amounts and is likely to urinate frequently, even at night, which can disrupt sleep and, on occasion, cause bedwetting. Because of the excretion of abnormally large volumes of dilute urine, people with DI may quickly become dehydrated if they do not drink enough water. Children with DI may be irritable or listless and may have fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Milder forms of DI can be managed by drinking enough water, usually between 2 and 2.5 liters a day. DI severe enough to endanger a person&apos;s health is rare. </ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q17-S1-A1" pairid="37">A gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a type of tumor that occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly in the stomach or small intestine. The tumors are thought to grow from specialized cells found in the gastrointestinal tract called interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) or precursors to these cells. GISTs are usually found in adults between ages 40 and 70; rarely, children and young adults develop these tumors. The tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).  Small tumors may cause no signs or symptoms. However, some people with GISTs may experience pain or swelling in the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or weight loss. Sometimes, tumors cause bleeding, which may lead to low red blood cell counts (anemia) and, consequently, weakness and tiredness. Bleeding into the intestinal tract may cause black and tarry stools, and bleeding into the throat or stomach may cause vomiting of blood.  Affected individuals with no family history of GIST typically have only one tumor (called a sporadic GIST). People with a family history of GISTs (called familial GISTs) often have multiple tumors and additional signs or symptoms, including noncancerous overgrowth (hyperplasia) of other cells in the gastrointestinal tract and patches of dark skin on various areas of the body. Some affected individuals have a skin condition called urticaria pigmentosa (also known as cutaneous mastocytosis), which is characterized by raised patches of brownish skin that sting or itch when touched.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q17-S2-A1" pairid="38">For patients with primary, localized gastrointestinal stromal tumors, surgery with complete excision is the treatment of choice.[1] However, surgery has limited efficacy in the treatment of recurrent and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors. These tumors are also resistant to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In the pre-imatinib era, the 5-year survival rate after the surgical resection of gastrointestinal stromal tumors was only 43%–80% as there was really no efficient method to cure the disease.[2] The addition of imatinib as part of the treatment of unresectable or recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumors has improved the management of this condition and resulted in improved patient survival.[1][2] Last updated: 4/27/2010  FDA-Approved Treatments The medication(s) listed below have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as orphan products for treatment of this condition.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q18-S1-A1" pairid="39">Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement. People with this condition initially experience problems with coordination and balance (ataxia). Other early signs and symptoms of SCA3 include speech difficulties, uncontrolled muscle tensing (dystonia), muscle stiffness (spasticity), rigidity, tremors, bulging eyes, and double vision. People with this condition may experience sleep disorders such as restless leg syndrome or REM sleep behavior disorder. Restless leg syndrome is a condition characterized by numbness or tingling in the legs accompanied by an urge to move the legs to stop the sensations. REM sleep behavior disorder is a condition in which the muscles are active during the dream (REM) stage of sleep, so an affected person often acts out his or her dreams. These sleep disorders tend to leave affected individuals feeling tired during the day.  Over time, individuals with SCA3 may develop loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy), muscle cramps, muscle twitches (fasciculations), and swallowing difficulties. Individuals with SCA3 may have problems with memory, planning, and problem solving.  Signs and symptoms of the disorder typically begin in mid-adulthood but can appear anytime from childhood to late adulthood. People with SCA3 eventually require wheelchair assistance. They usually survive 10 to 20 years after symptoms first appear.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q19-S1-A1" pairid="41">There is no specific cure for migraine headaches. The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away, and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers.   A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your doctor can plan how to avoid these triggers.  If you have frequent migraines, your doctor may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include:  - Antidepressants  - Blood pressure medicines  - Seizure medicines    Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month.  Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your doctor to see if riboflavin or magnesium are right for you.  TREATING AN ATTACK  Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that:   - Taking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine.  - Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver.  - Too much ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or kidneys.    If these treatments do not help, ask your doctor about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections.   Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your doctor before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.  Other medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other drugs that treat the migraine itself.   Feverfew is a herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people. Before using feverfew, make sure your doctor approves. Herbal remedies sold in drugstores and health food stores are not regulated. Work with a trained herbalist when selecting herbs.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q21-S1-A1" pairid="46">Most of the time, RA affects joints on both sides of the body equally. Wrists, fingers, knees, feet, and ankles are the most commonly affected.  The disease often begins slowly. Early symptoms may include minor joint pain, stiffness, and fatigue.   Joint symptoms may include:  - Morning stiffness, which lasts more than 1 hour, is common. Joints may feel warm, tender, and stiff when not used for an hour.  - Joint pain is often felt on the same joint on both sides of the body.  - Over time, joints may lose their range of motion and may become deformed.     Other symptoms include:  - Chest pain when taking a breath (pleurisy)  - Dry eyes and mouth (Sjogren syndrome)  - Eye burning, itching, and discharge  - Nodules under the skin (usually a sign of more severe disease)  - Numbness, tingling, or burning in the hands and feet  - Sleep difficulties</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q21-S1-A2" pairid="47">Swelling and Pain in the Joints Different types of arthritis have different symptoms. In general, people with most forms of arthritis have pain and stiffness in their joints. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by inflammation of the joint lining. This inflammation causes warmth, redness, swelling, and pain around the joints. A person also feels sick, tired, and sometimes feverish. Rheumatoid arthritis generally occurs in a symmetrical pattern. If one knee or hand is affected, the other one is also likely to be affected. Diagnostic Tests Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages for several reasons. There is no single test for the disease. In addition, symptoms differ from person to person and can be more severe in some people than in others. Common tests for rheumatoid arthritis include - The rheumatoid factor test. Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that is present eventually in the blood of most people with rheumatoid arthritis However, not all people with rheumatoid arthritis test positive for rheumatoid factor, especially early in the disease. Also, some people who do test positive never develop the disease. The rheumatoid factor test.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q24-S1-A1" pairid="51">If you have diabetes, nerve damage in the leg or foot, poor blood circulation to your foot, or an infection around the nail, go to the doctor right away. Do not try to treat an ingrown nail at home.  Otherwise, to treat an ingrown nail at home:  - Soak the foot in warm water 3 to 4 times a day if possible. After soaking, keep the toe dry.  - Gently massage over the inflamed skin.  - Place a small piece of cotton or dental floss under the nail. Wet the cotton with water or antiseptic.   When trimming your toenails:  - Briefly soak your foot in warm water to soften the nail.  - Use a clean, sharp trimmer.  - Trim toenails straight across the top. Do not taper or round the corners or trim too short. Do not try to cut out the ingrown portion of the nail yourself. This will only make the problem worse.   Consider wearing sandals until the problem goes away. Over-the-counter medicine that is applied to the ingrown toenail may help with the pain, but it does not treat the problem.  If this does not work and the ingrown nail gets worse, see your family doctor, a foot specialist (podiatrist) or a skin specialist (dermatologist).  If your ingrown nail does not heal or keeps coming back, your doctor may remove part of the nail:  - Numbing medicine is first injected into the toe.  - The doctor uses scissors to cut along the edge of the nail where the skin is growing over. This portion of the nail is removed. This procedure is called a partial nail avulsion.  - It takes 2 to 4 months for the nail to regrow.   Sometimes your doctor will use a chemical, electrical current, or another small surgical cut to destroy or remove the area from which a new nail may grow.  If the toe is infected, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q28-S1-A1" pairid="57">Most fissures heal on their own and do not need treatment.  To prevent or treat anal fissures in infants, be sure to change diapers often and clean the area gently.  CHILDREN AND ADULTS  Worrying about pain during a bowel movement may cause a person to avoid them. But not having bowel movements will only cause the stools to become even harder, which can make anal fissure worse.  Prevent hard stools and constipation by:  - Making dietary changes -- eating more fiber or bulk, such as fruits, vegetables, and grains  - Drinking more fluids  - Using stool softeners    Applying the following ointments or creams to the area may soothe the skin:  - Numbing cream, if pain interferes with normal bowel movements  - Petroleum jelly  - Zinc oxide, 1% hydrocortisone cream, Preparation H, and other products    A sitz bath is a warm water bath used for healing or cleansing. You should sit in the bath two to three times a day. The water should cover only your hips and buttocks.  If the anal fissures do not go away with home care methods, treatment may involve:  - Botox injections into the muscle in the anus (anal sphincter)  - Minor surgery to relax the anal muscle  - Prescription creams such as nitrates or calcium channel blockers, applied over the fissure to help relax the muscles</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q30-S2-A1" pairid="61">Nephrotic syndrome is caused by different disorders that damage the kidneys. This damage leads to the release of too much protein in the urine.  The most common cause in children is minimal change disease. Membranous glomerulonephritis is the most common cause in adults. In both diseases, the glomeruli in the kidneys are damaged. Glomeruli are the structures that help filter wastes and fluids.  This condition can also occur from:  - Cancer  - Diseases such as diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple myeloma, and amyloidosis  - Genetic disorders  - Immune disorders  - Infections (such as strep throat, hepatitis, or mononucleosis)  - Use of certain drugs   It can occur with kidney disorders such as:  - Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis  - Glomerulonephritis  - Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis   Nephrotic syndrome can affect all age groups. In children, it is most common between ages 2 and 6. This disorder occurs slightly more often in males than females.</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q30-S3-A1" pairid="62">The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and delay kidney damage. To control nephrotic syndrome, the disorder that is causing it must be treated. You may need treatment for life.  Treatments may include any of the following:  - Keeping blood pressure at or below 130/80 mm Hg to delay kidney damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the medicines most often used. ACE inhibitors and ARBs may also help decrease the amount of protein lost in the urine.  - Corticosteroids and other drugs that suppress or quiet the immune system.  - Treating high cholesterol to reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel problems. A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet is usually not enough for people with nephrotic syndrome. Medicines to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides (usually statins) may be needed.  - A low-salt diet may help with swelling in the hands and legs. Water pills (diuretics) may also help with this problem.  - Low-protein diets may be helpful. Your health care provider may suggest a moderate-protein diet (1 gram [gm] of protein per kilogram [kg] of body weight per day).  - Taking vitamin D supplements if nephrotic syndrome is long-term and is not responding to treatment.  - Taking blood thinner drugs to treat or prevent blood clots.</ANSWER>

My question is this, she was in the ER for 12 hours before she was even seen by the general surgeon and then he wasn&apos;t convinced that it was this condition yet.  He said that he&apos;d check on her in the morning once she was finally put into an ICU room (this was at 11 p.m.).  I last spoke to her at midnight that evening and that was the last time that she was conscious.  By the time she got to the ICU just 2-3 hours later, she was unresponsive and put on life support.  Surgery was eventually performed later that afternoon and 90% of her small intestine had to be removed.  She died early the next evening.  My question to you is did they wait too long to do anything for her?  Could she have been saved if surgery had been done sooner?

			<ANSWERS>			
				<ANSWER answerid="Q36-S1-A1" pairid="70">Leber congenital amaurosis is an eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this disorder typically have severe visual impairment beginning in infancy. The visual impairment tends to be stable, although it may worsen very slowly over time.  Leber congenital amaurosis is also associated with other vision problems, including an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia). The pupils, which usually expand and contract in response to the amount of light entering the eye, do not react normally to light. Instead, they expand and contract more slowly than normal, or they may not respond to light at all. Additionally, the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea) may be cone-shaped and abnormally thin, a condition known as keratoconus.  A specific behavior called Franceschetti&apos;s oculo-digital sign is characteristic of Leber congenital amaurosis. This sign consists of poking, pressing, and rubbing the eyes with a knuckle or finger. Researchers suspect that this behavior may contribute to deep-set eyes and keratoconus in affected children.  In rare cases, delayed development and intellectual disability have been reported in people with the features of Leber congenital amaurosis. However, researchers are uncertain whether these individuals actually have Leber congenital amaurosis or another syndrome with similar signs and symptoms.  At least 13 types of Leber congenital amaurosis have been described. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause, patterns of vision loss, and related eye abnormalities.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q37-S1-A1" pairid="71">When possible, the cause of cardiomyopathy is treated. Medicines and lifestyle changes are often needed to treat the symptoms of heart failure, angina, and abnormal heart rhythms.  Procedures or surgeries may also be used, including:  - A defibrillator that sends an electrical pulse to stop life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms  - A pacemaker that treats a slow heart rate or helps both sides of the heart beat at the same time  - Coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery or angioplasty that may improve blood flow to the damaged or weakened heart muscle  - Heart transplant that may be tried when all other treatments have failed    Recently, implantable artificial heart pumps have been developed. These may be used for very severe cases. However, not all patients need or are able to have this advanced treatment.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q37-S1-A2" pairid="72">People who have cardiomyopathy but no signs or symptoms may not need treatment. Sometimes, dilated cardiomyopathy that comes on suddenly may go away on its own. For other people who have cardiomyopathy, treatment is needed. Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy you have, the severity of your symptoms and complications, and your age and overall health. Treatments may include:                  Heart-healthy lifestyle changes                  Medicines                  Nonsurgical procedure                  Surgery and implanted devices                  The main goals of treating cardiomyopathy include:                  Controlling signs and symptoms so that you can live as normally as possible                  Managing any conditions that cause or contribute to the disease                  Reducing complications and the risk of sudden cardiac arrest                  Stopping the disease from getting worse                  Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes                  Your doctor may suggest lifestyle changes to manage a condition that’s causing your cardiomyopathy including:                  Heart-healthy eating                  Maintaining a healthy weight                  Managing stress                  Physical activity                  Quitting smoking                  Heart-Healthy Eating                  Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:                  Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as fat-free milk                  Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week                  Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes                  Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans                  Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots                  Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas                  When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:                  A lot of red meat                  Palm and coconut oils                  Sugary foods and beverages                  Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:                  Saturated fat—found mostly in foods that come from animals                  Trans fat (trans fatty acids)—found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats such as stick margarine; baked goods such as, cookies, cakes, and pies, crackers, frostings, and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.                  Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:                  Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels.                  Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:                  Avocados                  Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils                  Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts                  Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils                  Peanut butter                  Salmon and trout                  Tofu                  Sodium                  Try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and “no added salt” foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.                  Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension                  Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.                  The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who don’t have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.                  Alcohol                  Talk to your doctor about how much alcohol you drink. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Your doctor may recommend that you reduce the amount of alcohol you drink or stop drinking alcohol.                                    Maintaining a Healthy Weight                  Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.                  Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if you’re a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:                  Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.                  Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.                  Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.                  Of 30 or more is considered obese.                  A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.                  Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, you’re at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.                  If you’re overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.                                     Managing Stress                  Research shows that the most commonly reported “trigger” for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting event—particularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stress—such as drinking, smoking, or overeating—aren’t healthy.                  Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:                  A stress management program                  Meditation                  Physical activity                  Relaxation therapy                  Talking things out with friends or family                                     Physical Activity                  Routine physical activity can lower many risk factors for coronary heart disease, including LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the “good” cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.                  Everyone should try to participate in moderate intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week, or vigorous intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time spread throughout the week.                  Read more about physical activity at:                  Physical Activity and Your Heart                  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans                  Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.                                    Quitting Smoking                  If you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.                  If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.                  Read more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart.                                     Medicines                  Many medicines are used to treat cardiomyopathy. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to:                  Balance electrolytes in your body. Electrolytes are minerals that help maintain fluid levels and acid-base balance in the body. They also help muscle and nerve tissues work properly. Abnormal electrolyte levels may be a sign of dehydration (lack of fluid in your body), heart failure, high blood pressure, or other disorders. Aldosterone blockers are an example of a medicine used to balance electrolytes.                  Keep your heart beating with a normal rhythm. These medicines, called antiarrhythmics, help prevent arrhythmias.                  Lower your blood pressure. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers are examples of medicines that lower blood pressure.                  Prevent blood clots from forming. Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, are an example of a medicine that prevents blood clots. Blood thinners often are used to prevent blood clots from forming in people who have dilated cardiomyopathy.                  Reduce inflammation. Corticosteroids are an example of a medicine used to reduce inflammation.                   Remove excess sodium from your body. Diuretics, or water pills, are an example of medicines that help remove excess sodium from the body, which reduces the amount of fluid in your blood.                  Slow your heart rate. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin are examples of medicines that slow the heart rate. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers also are used to lower blood pressure.                  Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Don’t change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.                  ​Surgery and Implanted Devices                  Doctors use several types of surgery to treat cardiomyopathy, including septal myectomy, surgically implanted devices, and heart transplant.                  Septal Myectomy                  Septal myectomy is open-heart surgery and is used to treat people who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe symptoms. This surgery generally is used for younger patients and for people whose medicines aren’t working well.                  A surgeon removes part of the thickened septum that’s bulging into the left ventricle. This improves blood flow through the heart and out to the body. The removed tissue doesn’t grow back. If needed, the surgeon also can repair or replace the mitral valve at the same time. Septal myectomy often is successful and allows you to return to a normal life with no symptoms.                  Surgically Implanted Devices                  Surgeons can place several types of devices in the heart to improve function and symptoms, including:                  Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device. A CRT device coordinates contractions between the heart’s left and right ventricles.                  Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). An ICD helps control life-threatening arrhythmias that may lead to sudden cardiac arrest. This small device is implanted in the chest or abdomen and connected to the heart with wires. If an ICD senses a dangerous change in heart rhythm, it will send an electric shock to the heart to restore a normal heartbeat.                  Left ventricular assist device (LVAD). This device helps the heart pump blood to the body. An LVAD can be used as a long-term therapy or as a short-term treatment for people who are waiting for a heart transplant.                  Pacemaker. This small device is placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen to help control arrhythmias. The device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.                  Heart Transplant                  For this surgery, a surgeon replaces a person’s diseased heart with a healthy heart from a deceased donor. A heart transplant is a last resort treatment for people who have end-stage heart failure. “End-stage” means the condition has become so severe that all treatments, other than heart transplant, have failed. For more information about this treatment, go to the Heart Transplant Health Topic.                  Nonsurgical Procedure                  Doctors may use a nonsurgical procedure called alcohol septal ablation to treat cardiomyopathy. During this procedure, the doctor injects ethanol (a type of alcohol) through a tube into the small artery that supplies blood to the thickened area of heart muscle. The alcohol kills cells, and the thickened tissue shrinks to a more normal size. This procedure allows blood to flow freely through the ventricle, which improves symptoms.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q38-S1-A1" pairid="74">Albinism is a defect of melanin production that results in little or no color (pigment) in the skin, hair, and eyes.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q38-S1-A2" pairid="75">Albinism is a group of inherited disorders that results in little or no production of the pigment melanin, which determines the color of the skin, hair and eyes. Melanin also plays a role in the development of certain optical nerves, so all forms of albinism cause problems with the development and function of the eyes. Other symptoms can include light skin or changes in skin color; very white to brown hair; very light blue to brown eye color that may appear red in some light and may change with age; sensitivity to sun exposure; and increased risk of developing skin cancer. Albinism is caused by mutations in one of several genes, and most types are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Although there&apos;s no cure, people with the disorder can take steps to improve vision and avoid too much sun exposure.</ANSWER>

	<MESSAGE>Tests for Haemophilia. Hi, I was wondering if blood clotting assays are always positive if one has mild-moderate hemophilia and what the name is of the genetic tests for hemophilia? I have a history of internal spontaneous bleeding into the joints or with eating garlic or onions (in large amounts).I also hemmorhage after injuries (arm injury, head injury hemmorhage, and pregnancy birth hemmorhage--both times).  I&apos;ve had to have blood transfusions and shots to control the bleeding but it&apos;s usually possible to control it. I believe I may have passed this on to my son as he was determined by a doctor to be a heavy bleeder at circumcision. While on the [LOCATION]t, I was asked by a [LOCATION] if anyone had done a work-up on me for hemophilia or any clotting disorder and I said not to my knowledge.  I asked if they were going to do it and she said to follow up with a primary doctor for it.  She also said it could be expensive.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q41-S1-A1" pairid="81">Most often, hemophilia is diagnosed after a person has an abnormal bleeding episode. It can also be diagnosed by a blood test done to detect the problem, if other family members have the condition.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q41-S1-A2" pairid="82">If you or your child appears to have a bleeding problem, your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories. This will reveal whether you or your family members, including women and girls, have bleeding problems. However, some people who have hemophilia have no recent family history of the disease.                  You or your child also will likely have a physical exam and blood tests to diagnose hemophilia. Blood tests are used to find out:                  How long it takes for your blood to clot                  Whether your blood has low levels of any clotting factors                  Whether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood                  The test results will show whether you have hemophilia, what type of hemophilia you have, and how severe it is.                  Hemophilia A and B are classified as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the amount of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood.                  The severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories. For example, some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia.                  Severe hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies. Thus, children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life. People who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they&apos;re adults.                  The bleeding problems of hemophilia A and hemophilia B are the same. Only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has. Knowing which type is important because the treatments are different.                  Pregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies.                  Women who are hemophilia carriers also can have &quot;preimplantation diagnosis&quot; to have children who don&apos;t have hemophilia.                  For this process, women have their eggs removed and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory. The embryos are then tested for hemophilia. Only embryos without the disorder are implanted in the womb.</ANSWER>

People with fibromalgia may also have tenderness in the joints, muscles, tendons, and other soft tissues.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q46-S1-A2" pairid="91">Summary       Fibromyalgia is a disorder that causes muscle pain and fatigue. People with fibromyalgia have &quot;tender points&quot; on the body. Tender points are specific places on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs. These points hurt when pressure is put on them.    People with fibromyalgia may also have other symptoms, such as       - Trouble sleeping    - Morning stiffness    - Headaches    - Painful menstrual periods    - Tingling or numbness in hands and feet    - Problems with thinking and memory (sometimes called &quot;fibro fog&quot;)       No one knows what causes fibromyalgia. Anyone can get it, but it is most common in middle-aged women. People with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases are particularly likely to develop fibromyalgia. There is no cure for fibromyalgia, but medicine can help you manage your symptoms. Getting enough sleep, exercising, and eating well may also help.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q47-S1-A1" pairid="92">Your health care provider can treat a wart if you do not like how it looks or if it is painful.  Do NOT attempt to remove a wart yourself by burning, cutting, tearing, picking, or by any other method.  MEDICINES  Over-the-counter medicines are available to remove warts.   Do NOT use over-the-counter wart medicines on your face or genitals. Warts in these areas need to be treated by a health care provider.  To use wart-removal medicine:  - File the wart with a nail file or emery board when your skin is damp (for example, after a shower or bath). This helps remove dead tissue. Do not use the same emery board on your nails.  - Put the medicine on the wart every day for several weeks or months. Follow the instructions on the label.  - Cover the wart with a bandage to prevent it from spreading.     OTHER TREATMENTS  Special foot cushions can help ease the pain from plantar warts. You can buy these at drugstores without a prescription. Use socks. Wear shoes with plenty of room. Avoid high heels.  Your health care provider may need to trim away thick skin or calluses that form over warts on your foot or around nails.   Your provider may recommend the following treatments if your warts do not go away:  - Stronger (prescription) medicines  - A blistering solution   - Freezing the wart (cryotherapy) to remove it  - Burning the wart (electrocautery) to remove it  - Laser treatment for difficult to remove warts  - Immunotherapy, which gives you a shot of a substance that causes an allergic reaction and helps the wart go away  - Skin medicine called imiquimod    Genital warts are treated in a different way than most other warts.  A medicine called veregen may be used on genital warts, as well as on other warts.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q50-S1-A1" pairid="95">Gastroparesis is a condition that reduces the ability of the stomach to empty its contents. It does not involve a blockage (obstruction).</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q50-S1-A2" pairid="96">Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q50-S1-A3" pairid="97">The problems of gastroparesis can include                  - severe dehydration due to persistent vomiting  - gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis— irritation of the esophagus  - bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form  - difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes  - malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake  - decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms</ANSWER>

You could become blind.  - Your feet and skin could develop sores and infections. If you have these sores for too long, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infection can also cause pain and itching.  - Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to the legs and feet.  - Nerves in the body can become damaged, causing pain, itching, tingling, and numbness.  - Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can also make it harder for men to have an erection.  - High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage. The kidneys may not work as well as they used to. They may even stop working, so that you would need dialysis or a kidney transplant.</ANSWER>

				<FOCUS>hypotension</FOCUS>
				<TYPE>information</TYPE>
			</ANNOTATIONS>
			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q53-S1-A1" pairid="100">Low blood pressure occurs when blood pressure is much lower than normal. This means the heart, brain, and other parts of the body do not get enough blood. Normal blood pressure is usually between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg.  The medical name for low blood pressure is hypotension.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q53-S1-A2" pairid="101">Summary       You&apos;ve probably heard that high blood pressure is a problem. Sometimes blood pressure that is too low can also cause problems.    Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps out blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually they&apos;re written one above or before the other, such as 120/80. If your blood pressure reading is 90/60 or lower, you have low blood pressure.     Some people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no symptoms and their low readings are normal for them. In other people, blood pressure drops below normal because of a medical condition or certain medicines. Some people may have symptoms of low blood pressure when standing up too quickly. Low blood pressure is a problem only if it causes dizziness, fainting or in extreme cases, shock.     NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q53-S1-A3" pairid="102">Hypotension (HI-po-TEN-shun) is abnormally low blood pressure. Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps out blood.                  Blood pressure is measured as systolic (sis-TOL-ik) and diastolic (di-a-STOL-ik) pressures. &quot;Systolic&quot; refers to blood pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood. &quot;Diastolic&quot; refers to blood pressure when the heart is at rest between beats.                  You most often will see blood pressure numbers written with the systolic number above or before the diastolic number, such as 120/80 mmHg. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercury—the units used to measure blood pressure.)                  Normal blood pressure in adults is lower than 120/80 mmHg. Hypotension is blood pressure that&apos;s lower than 90/60 mmHg.                  Overview                  Blood pressure doesn&apos;t stay the same all the time. It lowers as you sleep and rises when you wake up. Blood pressure also rises when you&apos;re excited, nervous, or active.                  Your body is very sensitive to changes in blood pressure. For example, if you stand up quickly, your blood pressure may drop for a short time. Your body adjusts your blood pressure to make sure enough blood and oxygen are flowing to your brain, kidneys, and other vital organs.                  Most forms of hypotension happen because your body can&apos;t bring blood pressure back to normal or can&apos;t do it fast enough.                  Some people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no signs or symptoms, and their low blood pressure is normal for them.                  In other people, certain conditions or factors cause abnormally low blood pressure. As a result, less blood and oxygen flow to the body&apos;s organs.                  For the most part, hypotension is a medical concern only if it causes signs or symptoms or is linked to a serious condition, such as heart disease. Signs and symptoms of hypotension may include dizziness, fainting, cold and sweaty skin, fatigue (tiredness), blurred vision, or nausea (feeling sick to your stomach).                  In extreme cases, hypotension can lead to shock.                  Outlook                  In a healthy person, low blood pressure without signs or symptoms usually isn&apos;t a problem and needs no treatment. If it causes signs or symptoms, your doctor will try to find and treat the condition that&apos;s causing it.                  Hypotension can be dangerous. It can make you fall because of dizziness or fainting. Shock, a severe form of hypotension, is a condition that&apos;s often fatal if not treated right away. With prompt and proper treatment, shock can be successfully treated.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q56-S1-A2" pairid="110">Summary       Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a condition that occurs in men who have an extra X chromosome. The syndrome can affect different stages of physical, language, and social development.    The most common symptom is infertility. Boys may be taller than other boys their age, with more fat around the belly. After puberty, KS boys may have       - Smaller testes and penis    - Breast growth    - Less facial and body hair    - Reduced muscle tone    - Narrower shoulders and wider hips    - Weaker bones    - Decreased sexual interest    - Lower energy       KS males may have learning or language problems. They may be quiet and shy and have trouble fitting in.    A genetic test can diagnose KS. There is no cure, but treatments are available. It is important to start treatment as early as possible. With treatment, most boys grow up to have normal lives.    Treatments include testosterone replacement therapy and breast reduction surgery. If needed, physical, speech, language, and occupational therapy may also help.    NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q56-S1-A3" pairid="112">Klinefelter syndrome is a chromosomal condition that affects male physical and cognitive development. Its signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals.  Affected individuals typically have small testes that do not produce as much testosterone as usual. Testosterone is the hormone that directs male sexual development before birth and during puberty. A shortage of testosterone can lead to delayed or incomplete puberty, breast enlargement (gynecomastia), reduced facial and body hair, and an inability to have biological children (infertility). Some affected individuals also have genital differences including undescended testes (cryptorchidism), the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis (hypospadias), or an unusually small penis (micropenis).  Older children and adults with Klinefelter syndrome tend to be taller than their peers. Compared with unaffected men, adults with Klinefelter syndrome have an increased risk of developing breast cancer and a chronic inflammatory disease called systemic lupus erythematosus. Their chance of developing these disorders is similar to that of women in the general population.  Children with Klinefelter syndrome may have learning disabilities and delayed speech and language development. They tend to be quiet, sensitive, and unassertive, but personality characteristics vary among affected individuals.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q59-S1-A1" pairid="122">The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of copper in the tissues. This is done by a procedure called chelation -- certain medications can bind to copper and help remove it through the kidneys or gut. Treatment must be lifelong.  The following medications may be used:  - Penicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen) binds to copper and leads to increased release of copper in the urine.  - Trientine (Syprine) binds (chelates) the copper and increases its release through the urine.  - Zinc acetate (Galzin) blocks copper from being absorbed in the intestinal tract.    Vitamin E supplements may also be used.  Sometimes, medications that chelate copper (especially penicillamine) can affect the function of the brain and nervous system (neurological function). Other medications under investigation may bind copper without affecting neurological function.  A low-copper diet may also be recommended. Foods to avoid include:  - Chocolate  - Dried fruit  - Liver  - Mushrooms  - Nuts  - Shellfish    You may want to drink distilled water because most tap water flows through copper pipes. Avoid using copper cooking utensils.  Symptoms may be treated with exercise or physical therapy. People who are confused or unable to care for themselves may need special protective measures.  A liver transplant may be considered in cases where the liver is severely damaged by the disease.</ANSWER>

	<MESSAGE>Dear Sir,  My mother is 80 years old. Her eye sight has nearly vanished. Years back left eye sight ended due to optical nerve rupture. On the right eye a white growth has now covered almost the whole retina. The specialists say that this growth is a result of eye surgeries she got years back and now there is no solution for this. Now she can hardly see the shadow things lying very close to her. I would be grateful if you kindly guide me if there is any solution for this.  Thanks</MESSAGE>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q62-S1-A1" pairid="129">If you have low vision, eyeglasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery may not help. Activities like reading, shopping, cooking, writing, and watching TV may be hard to do. The leading causes of low vision and blindness in the United States are age-related eye diseases: macular degeneration, cataract and glaucoma. Other eye disorders, eye injuries, and birth defects can also cause vision loss. Whatever the cause, lost vision cannot be restored. It can, however, be managed. A loss of vision means that you may have to reorganize your life and learn new ways of doing things. If you have some vision, visual aids such as special glasses and large print books can make life easier. There are also devices to help those with no vision, like text-reading software and braille books. The sooner vision loss or eye disease is found and treated, the greater your chances of keeping your remaining vision. You should have regular comprehensive eye exams by an eye care professional.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q63-S3-A1" pairid="133">Treatment may involve moving the foot into the correct position and using a cast to keep it there. This is often done by an orthopedic specialist. Treatment should be started as early as possible -- ideally, shortly after birth -- when it is easiest to reshape the foot.  Gentle stretching and recasting will be done every week to improve the position of the foot. Generally, five to 10 casts are needed. The final cast will stay in place for 3 weeks. After the foot is in the correct position, the child will wear a special brace nearly full time for 3 months. Then, the child will wear the brace at night and during naps for up to 3 years.  Often, the problem is a tightened Achilles tendon, and a simple procedure is needed to release it.  Some severe cases of clubfoot will need surgery if other treatments do not work, or if the problem returns. The child should be monitored by a health care provider until the foot is fully grown.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q63-S4-A1" pairid="134">Tay-Sachs disease is a life-threatening disease of the nervous system passed down through families.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q63-S4-A2" pairid="135">Summary       Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, inherited disorder. It causes too much of a fatty substance to build up in the brain. This buildup destroys nerve cells, causing mental and physical problems.    Infants with Tay-Sachs disease appear to develop normally for the first few months of life. Then mental and physical abilities decline. The child becomes blind, deaf, and unable to swallow. Muscles begin to waste away and paralysis sets in. Even with the best of care, children with Tay-Sachs disease usually die by age 4.    The cause is a gene mutation which is most common in Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews. To get the disease, both parents must have the gene. If they do, there is a 25% chance of the child having the disease. A blood test and prenatal tests can check for the gene or the disease.    There is no cure. Medicines and good nutrition can help some symptoms. Some children need feeding tubes.    NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q63-S4-A3" pairid="136">Tay-Sachs disease is a rare inherited disorder that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Tay-Sachs is caused by the absence of a vital enzyme called hexosaminidase-A (Hex-A). Without Hex-A, a fatty substance, or lipid, called GM2 ganglioside accumulates abnormally in cells, especially in the nerve cells of the brain. This ongoing accumulation causes progressive damage to the cells. Tay-Sachs disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q63-S4-A4" pairid="137">Tay-Sachs disease is a rare inherited disorder that progressively destroys nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord.  The most common form of Tay-Sachs disease becomes apparent in infancy. Infants with this disorder typically appear normal until the age of 3 to 6 months, when their development slows and muscles used for movement weaken. Affected infants lose motor skills such as turning over, sitting, and crawling. They also develop an exaggerated startle reaction to loud noises. As the disease progresses, children with Tay-Sachs disease experience seizures, vision and hearing loss, intellectual disability, and paralysis. An eye abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination, is characteristic of this disorder. Children with this severe infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease usually live only into early childhood.  Other forms of Tay-Sachs disease are very rare. Signs and symptoms can appear in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood and are usually milder than those seen with the infantile form. Characteristic features include muscle weakness, loss of muscle coordination (ataxia) and other problems with movement, speech problems, and mental illness. These signs and symptoms vary widely among people with late-onset forms of Tay-Sachs disease.</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q63-S5-A1" pairid="138">Tay-Sachs disease occurs when the body lacks hexosaminidase A. This is a protein that helps break down a group of chemicals found in nerve tissue called gangliosides. Without this protein, gangliosides, particularly ganglioside GM2, build up in cells, especially nerve cells in the brain.  Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a defective gene on chromosome 15. When both parents carry the defective Tay-Sachs gene, a child has a 25% chance of developing the disease. The child must receive two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent, in order to become sick. If only one parent passes the defective gene to the child, the child is called a carrier. They will not be sick, but may pass the disease to their own children.  Anyone can be a carrier of Tay-Sachs. But, the disease is most common among the Ashkenazi Jewish population. 1 in every 27 members of the population carries the Tay-Sachs gene.  Tay-Sachs is divided into infantile, juvenile, and adult forms, depending on the symptoms and when they first appear. Most people with Tay-Sachs have the infantile form. In this form, the nerve damage usually begins while the baby is still in the womb. Symptoms usually appear when the child is 3 to 6 months old. The disease tends to get worse very quickly, and the child usually dies by age 4 or 5.  Late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, which affects adults, is very rare.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q63-S7-A2" pairid="141">Although several attempts have been made at purified enzyme replacement therapy for children with Tay-Sachs disease, none has been successful. Cellular infusions and even bone marrow transplantation have been attempted with no evidence of benefit. Because no specific treatment is available for Tay-Sachs disease, treatment is directed at the symptoms and major associated conditions. Treatment is supportive and aimed at providing adequate nutrition and hydration. The airway must be protected. Seizures can be controlled initially with conventional anticonvulsant medications such as benzodiazepines, phenytoins, and/or barbiturates, but the progressive nature of the disease may require alteration of dosage or medication. Infectious diseases should be managed. In advanced disease, good bowel movement should be maintained and severe constipation should be avoided. Good hydration, food additives, stool softeners, laxatives, and other measures should be employed to avoid severe constipation.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q64-S1-A1" pairid="143">Treatment depends on many things:  - The cause of scoliosis  - Where the curve is in your spine  - How big the curve is  - If your body is still growing   Most people with idiopathic scoliosis do not need treatment. But you should still be checked by a doctor about every 6 months.   If you are still growing, your doctor might recommend a back brace. A back brace prevents further curving. There are many different types of braces. What kind you get depends on the size and location of your curve. Your provider will pick the best one for you and show you how to use it. Back braces can be adjusted as you grow.  Back braces work best in people over age 10. Braces do not work for those with congenital or neuromuscular scoliosis.   You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly.  Surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible:  - Surgery is done with a cut through the back, belly area, or beneath the ribs.  - The spine bones are held in place with 1 or 2 metal rods. The rods are held down with hooks and screws until the bone heals together.  - After surgery, you may need to wear a brace for a while to keep the spine still.   Scoliosis treatment may also include:  - Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace.  - Physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q65-S1-A1" pairid="144">A substance called plaque can build up in the walls of your coronary arteries. This plaque is made up of cholesterol and other cells.   A heart attack may occur when:  - A tear in the plaque occurs. This triggers blood platelets and other substances to form a blood a clot at the site that blocks most or all of the oxygen-carrying blood from flowing to a part of the heart muscle. This is the most common cause of heart attack.  - A slow buildup of plaque may narrow one of the coronary arteries so that it is almost blocked.    In either case, there is not enough blood flow to the heart muscle and heart muscle dies.  The cause of heart attack is not always known.    Heart attack may occur:   - When you are resting or asleep  - After a sudden increase in physical activity  - When you are active outside in cold weather  - After sudden, severe emotional or physical stress, including an illness    Many risk factors may lead to the development of plaque buildup and a heart attack.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q65-S1-A2" pairid="145">Coronary Heart Disease                  A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can&apos;t get oxygen. Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD).                  CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside of the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.                  When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. The buildup of plaque occurs over many years.                  Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque&apos;s surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.                  If the blockage isn&apos;t treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems.                  Coronary Artery Spasm                  A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren&apos;t affected by atherosclerosis.                  What causes a coronary artery to spasm isn&apos;t always clear. A spasm may be related to:                  Taking certain drugs, such as cocaine                  Emotional stress or pain                  Exposure to extreme cold                  Cigarette smoking                  The animation below shows how plaque buildup or a coronary artery spasm can lead to a heart attack.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q65-S1-A3" pairid="146">Most heart attacks are caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that bring blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. When blood cannot reach part of your heart, that area starves for oxygen. If the blockage continues long enough, cells in the affected area die. The Most Common Cause Coronary heart disease (CHD)is the most common underlying cause of a heart attack. CHD, also called coronary artery disease, is the hardening and narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by the buildup of plaque inside the walls of the arteries. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-O-sis). The buildup of plaque occurs over many years. Over time, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque&apos;s surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. If the blockage isn&apos;t treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems. Other Causes Heart attack also can occur due to problems with the very small, microscopic blood vessels of the heart. This condition is called microvascular disease. It&apos;s believed to be more common in women than in men. A less common cause of heart attacks is a severe spasm or tightening of the coronary artery that cuts off blood flow to the heart. These spasms can occur in persons with or without coronary artery disease. What causes a coronary artery to spasm isn&apos;t always clear. A spasm may be related to emotional stress or pain, exposure to extreme cold, cigarette smoking, or by taking certain drugs like cocaine. Risk Factors You Cannot Change Certain factors make it more likely that you will develop coronary artery disease and have a heart attack. These risk factors include some things you cannot change. If you are a man over age 45 or a woman over age 55, you are at greater risk. Having a family history of early heart disease, diagnosed in a father or brother before age 55 or in a mother or sister before age 65, is another risk factor. You are also at risk if you have a personal history of angina or previous heart attack, or if you have had a heart procedure such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Risk Factors You Can Change Importantly, there are many risk factors that you can change. These include - smoking  - being overweight or obese  - physical inactivity  - high blood pressure  - high blood cholesterol  - high blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes   - an unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium). smoking being overweight or obese physical inactivity high blood pressure high blood cholesterol high blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes an unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium). Metabolic Syndrome Some of these risk factors—such as obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar—tend to occur together. When they do, it&apos;s called metabolic syndrome. In general, a person with metabolic syndrome is twice as likely to develop heart disease and five times as likely to develop diabetes as someone without metabolic syndrome.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q65-S2-A1" pairid="147">Treatments for atherosclerosis may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures or surgery. The goals of treatment include:      Lowering the risk of blood clots forming     Preventing atherosclerosis-related diseases     Reducing risk factors in an effort to slow or stop the buildup of plaque     Relieving symptoms     Widening or bypassing plaque-clogged arteries  Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes  Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have atherosclerosis. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include heart-healthy eating, aiming for a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity and quitting smoking. Medicines  Sometimes lifestyle changes alone aren’t enough to control your cholesterol levels. For example, you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:      Coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke     Diabetes     High LDL cholesterol levels  Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with people who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:      Lower your blood pressure     Lower your blood sugar levels     Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke     Prevent inflammation  Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Don’t change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your atherosclerosis. Medical Procedures and Surgery  If you have severe atherosclerosis, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure or surgery.  Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure that’s used to open blocked or narrowed coronary (heart) arteries. PCI can improve blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to keep it open after the procedure.  Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery. In CABG, arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass or go around your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.  Bypass grafting also can be used for leg arteries. For this surgery, a healthy blood vessel is used to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery in one of the legs. The healthy blood vessel redirects blood around the blocked artery, improving blood flow to the leg.  Carotid endarterectomy is a type of surgery to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries in the neck. This procedure restores blood flow to the brain, which can help prevent a stroke.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q66-S1-A1" pairid="148">Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears.   Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.  Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results.  Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all.  A woman&apos;s sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include:   - Having sex at an early age  - Having multiple sexual partners  - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities    Other risk factors for cervical cancer include:  - Not getting the HPV vaccine  - Being economically disadvantaged  - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage  - Having a weakened immune system</ANSWER>

For example, regular exercise and improved sleep habits may reduce anxiety and help relieve bowel symptoms.  Dietary changes can be helpful. However, no specific diet can be recommended for IBS because the condition differs from one person to another.  The following changes may help:  - Avoiding foods and drinks that stimulate the intestines (such as caffeine, tea, or colas)  - Eating smaller meals  - Increasing fiber in the diet (this may improve constipation or diarrhea, but make bloating worse)    Talk with your provider before taking over-the-counter medicines.  No one medicine works for everyone. Some that your provider may suggest include:  - Anticholinergic medicines (dicyclomine, propantheline, belladonna, and hyoscyamine) taken about a half-hour before eating to control intestinal muscle spasms  - Bisacodyl to treat constipation  - Loperamide to treat diarrhea  - Low doses of tricyclic antidepressants to help relieve intestinal pain  - Lubiprostone for constipation symptoms  - Rifaximin, an antibiotic    Psychological therapy or medicines for anxiety or depression may help with the problem.</ANSWER>

If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function 90% Abnormality of the autonomic nervous system 90% Developmental regression 90% EEG abnormality 90% Hallucinations 90% Hypertonia 90% Hypotension 90% Sleep disturbance 90% Sudden cardiac death 90% Gait disturbance 50% Incoordination 50% Neurological speech impairment 50% Abnormality of the sense of smell 7.5% Feeding difficulties in infancy 7.5% Involuntary movements 7.5% Restrictive lung disease 7.5% Skin ulcer 7.5% Tremor 7.5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Delusions - Dementia - Fluctuations in consciousness - Parkinsonism - Visual hallucinations - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q72-S1-A1" pairid="159">Type 2 diabetes may be reversed with lifestyle changes, especially losing weight with exercise and by eating healthier foods. Some cases of type 2 diabetes can also be improved with weight-loss surgery.  There is no cure for type 1 diabetes.   Treating either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes involves medicines, diet, and exercise to control blood sugar level.  Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your provider about seeing a diabetes nurse educator.   Getting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk of kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke.  To prevent diabetes complications, visit your provider at least 2 to 4 times a year. Talk about any problems you are having. Follow your provider&apos;s instructions on managing your diabetes.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q72-S1-A2" pairid="160">The goal of treatment at first is to lower your high blood glucose levels. Long-term goals are to prevent problems from diabetes.  The most important way to treat and manage type 2 diabetes is with activity and healthy eating.  Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your healthcare provider about seeing a diabetes educator.   LEARN THESE SKILLS  Learning diabetes management skills will help you live well with diabetes. These skills help prevent health problems and the need for medical care. Skills include:  - How to test and record your blood glucose  - What and when to eat  - How to safely increase your activity and control your weight  - How to take medications, if needed  - How to recognize and treat low and high blood sugar  - How to handle sick days  - Where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them    It may take several months to learn these skills. Keep learning about diabetes, its complications, and how to control and live well with the disease. Stay up-to-date on new research and treatments.  MANAGING YOUR BLOOD SUGAR  Checking your blood sugar levels yourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.  To check your blood sugar level, you use a device called a glucose meter. Usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet. This gives you a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. The meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.  Your doctor or diabetes educator will help set up a testing schedule for you. Your doctor will help you set a target range for your blood sugar numbers. Keep these factors in mind:  - Most people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day.  - If your blood sugar level is under control, you may only need to check it a few times a week.  - You may test yourself when you wake up, before meals, and at bedtime.  - You may need to test more often when you are sick or under stress.    Keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor. Based on your numbers, you may need to make changes to your meals, activity, or medicines to keep your blood sugar level in the right range.   HEALTHY EATING AND WEIGHT CONTROL  Work closely with your doctor, nurse, and dietitian to learn how much fat, protein, and carbohydrates you need in your diet. Your meal plans should fit your lifestyle and habits and should include foods that you like.  Managing your weight and having a well-balanced diet are important. Some people with type 2 diabetes can stop taking medicines after losing weight. This does not mean that their diabetes is cured. They still have diabetes.  Very obese patients whose diabetes is not well managed with diet and medicine may consider weight loss (bariatric) surgery.  REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  Regular activity is important for everyone. It is even more important when you have diabetes. Exercise is good for your health because it:  - Lowers your blood sugar level without medicine  - Burns extra calories and fat to help manage your weight  - Improves blood flow and blood pressure  - Increases your energy level  - Improves your ability to handle stress    Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. People with type 2 diabetes may need to take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.   MEDICATIONS TO TREAT DIABETES  If diet and exercise do not help keep your blood sugar at normal or near-normal levels, your doctor may prescribe medication. Since these drugs help lower your blood sugar levels in different ways, your doctor may have you take more than one drug.  Some of the most common types of medication are listed below. They are taken by mouth or injection.  - Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors  - Biguanides  - DPP IV inhibitors  - Injectable medicines (GLP-1 analogs)  - Meglitinides  - SGL T2 inhibitors  - Sulfonylureas  - Thiazolidinediones    You may need to take insulin if your blood sugar cannot be controlled with any of the above medicines. Insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or pump. It cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.  PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS  Your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing some of the more common complications of diabetes, including:   - Eye disease  - Kidney disease  - Heart disease and stroke   FOOT CARE  People with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. Diabetes damages the nerves. This can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. You many not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.  Diabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.  To prevent problems with your feet:  - Stop smoking if you smoke.  - Improve control of your blood sugar.  - Get a foot exam by your doctor at least twice a year and learn if you have nerve damage.  - Check and care for your feet every day. This is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems.  - Treat minor infections, such as athlete&apos;s foot, right away.  - Use moisturizing lotion on dry skin.  - Make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. Ask your doctor what type of shoe is right for you.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q73-S1-A1" pairid="161">Most cases of Angelman syndrome are not inherited, particularly those caused by a deletion in the maternal chromosome 15 or by paternal uniparental disomy. These genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development. In these instances, people typically have no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, a genetic change responsible for Angelman syndrome can be inherited. For example, it is possible for a mutation in the UBE3A gene or in the nearby region of DNA that controls gene activation to be passed from one generation to the next.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q74-S1-A1" pairid="165">Summary       Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes.    Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes.    Blood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test, the A1C, can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Exercise, weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes. You should also monitor your blood glucose level and take medicine if prescribed.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q74-S1-A2" pairid="166">Summary       Diabetes means your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth.    You have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if you are older, obese, have a family history of diabetes, or do not exercise. Having prediabetes also increases your risk. Prediabetes means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes.    The symptoms of type 2 diabetes appear slowly. Some people do not notice symptoms at all. The symptoms can include       - Being very thirsty    - Urinating often    - Feeling very hungry or tired    - Losing weight without trying    - Having sores that heal slowly    - Having blurry eyesight       Blood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test, the A1C, can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Many people can manage their diabetes through healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing. Some people also need to take diabetes medicines.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q74-S1-A3" pairid="167">Too Much Glucose in the Blood Diabetes means your blood glucose (often called blood sugar) is too high. Your blood always has some glucose in it because your body needs glucose for energy to keep you going. But too much glucose in the blood isn&apos;t good for your health. Glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver and muscles. Your blood carries the glucose to all of the cells in your body. Insulin is a chemical (a hormone) made by the pancreas. The pancreas releases insulin into the blood. Insulin helps the glucose from food get into your cells. If your body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin doesn&apos;t work the way it should, glucose can&apos;t get into your cells. It stays in your blood instead. Your blood glucose level then gets too high, causing pre-diabetes or diabetes. Types of Diabetes There are three main kinds of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. The result of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is the same: glucose builds up in the blood, while the cells are starved of energy. Over the years, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, oftentimes leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, nerve problems, gum infections, and amputation. Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes, which used to be called called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, develops most often in young people. However, type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults. With this form of diabetes, your body no longer makes insulin or doesn’t make enough insulin because your immune system has attacked and destroyed the insulin-producing cells. About 5 to 10 percent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. To survive, people with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered by injection or a pump. Learn more about type 1 diabetes here. Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes or non insulin-dependent diabetes, is the most common form of diabetes. Although people can develop type 2 diabetes at any age -- even during childhood -- type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance—a condition that occurs when fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the body’s cells to use for energy. As a result, the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. At first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by making more insulin. Over time, the pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin when blood sugar levels increase, such as after meals. If your pancreas can no longer make enough insulin, you will need to treat your type 2 diabetes. Learn more about type 2 diabetes here. Gestational Diabetes Some women develop gestational diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of pregnancy or a shortage of insulin. Although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had it and her child are more likely to develop diabetes later in life. Prediabetes Prediabetes means your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. People with prediabetes are at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes and for heart disease and stroke. The good news is that if you have prediabetes, you can reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes. With modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.  Learn more about prediabetes here.  Signs of Diabetes Many people with diabetes experience one or more symptoms, including extreme thirst or hunger, a frequent need to urinate and/or fatigue. Some lose weight without trying. Additional signs include sores that heal slowly, dry, itchy skin, loss of feeling or tingling in the feet and blurry eyesight. Some people with diabetes, however, have no symptoms at all. How Many Have Diabetes? Nearly 29 million Americans age 20 or older (12.3 percent of all people in this age group) have diabetes, according to 2014 estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 1.9 million people aged 20 years or older were newly diagnosed with diabetes in 2010 alone. People can get diabetes at any age, but the risk increases as we get older. In 2014, over 11 million older adults living in the U.S -- nearly 26 percent of people 65 or older -- had diabetes. See more statistics about diabetes from the  National Diabetes Statistics Report 2014. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) If Diabetes is Not Managed Diabetes is a very serious disease. Over time, diabetes that is not well managed causes serious damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, gums and teeth. If you have diabetes, you are more likely than people without diabetes to have heart disease or a stroke. People with diabetes also tend to develop heart disease or stroke at an earlier age than others. The best way to protect yourself from the serious complications of diabetes is to manage your blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol and to avoid smoking. It is not always easy, but people who make an ongoing effort to manage their diabetes can greatly improve their overall health.</ANSWER>

Trimethylamine has been described as smelling like rotting fish, rotting eggs, garbage, or urine. As this compound builds up in the body, it causes affected people to give off a strong odor in their sweat, urine, and breath. The intensity of the odor may vary over time. The odor can interfere with many aspects of daily life, affecting a person&apos;s relationships, social life, and career.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q75-S2-A1" pairid="175">Although there is no cure for trimethylaminuria, the following are some ways to reduce symptoms of odor:[1][3] Avoidance of foods that contain trimethylamine and its precursors (choline, lecithin, and trimethylamine N-oxide). Trimethylamine is present in high levels in milk obtained from wheat-fed cows. Choline is present in high amounts in: eggs, liver, kidney, peas, beans, peanuts, soy products, brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower. Trimethylamine N-oxide is present in seafood   Low doses of antibiotics. This decreases the amount of trimethylamine that is made by bacteria in the intestines   Laxatives can decrease the amount of time food remains in the intestines and therefore reduce the amount of trimethylamine made   Nutritional supplements (activated charcoal and copper chlorophyllin) can decrease the concentration of trimethylamine in the urine Soaps with a moderate pH (between 5.5 and 6.5) can help remove the secreted trimethylamine from the skin Riboflavin (vitamin B2) supplements can enhance any existing FMO3 enzyme activity (which breaks down trimethylamine)   Avoidance of exercise, stress, emotional upsets, and other factors that can promote sweating People with trimethylaminuria may also find the following to be helpful:[1] Behavioral counseling to help with depression and other psychological symptoms Genetic counseling to better understand how they developed trimethylaminuria and the risks of passing the condition on to their children NOTE: People should follow the treatment advice of their healthcare provider and should not attempt to self-administer these treatment approaches. Medications and supplements can have unintended interactions, and dietary restrictions can result in nutritional deficits. Last updated: 1/24/2017</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q77-S1-A1" pairid="177">A stroke is a medical emergency. Quick treatment is needed. Call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the first signs of a stroke.   People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible.   - If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting drug may be given to dissolve the clot.  - To be effective, this treatment must be started within 3 to 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms first started. The sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome.    Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include:   - Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix)  - Medicine to control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol  - Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes  - Nutrients and fluids    Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed.  The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes.   Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehabilitation center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center. Be sure to follow up with your health care provider after you go home.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q77-S1-A2" pairid="178">Generally there are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after the stroke, and post-stroke rehabilitation. Therapies to prevent a first or recurrent stroke are based on treating an individual&apos;s underlying risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes. Acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot causing an ischemic stroke or by stopping the bleeding of a hemorrhagic stroke. Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage. Medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke. The most popular classes of drugs used to prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) and thrombolytics.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q78-S1-A1" pairid="182">The goal of treatment is to control your symptoms and prevent infection.  Three treatment options are available:  - Skin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos. These are called topical treatments.  - Pills or injections that affect the body&apos;s immune response, not just the skin. These are called systemic, or body-wide, treatments.  - Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis.    TREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL)  Most of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp. These may include:  - Cortisone creams and ointments  - Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin  - Creams to remove the scaling (usually salicylic acid or lactic acid)  - Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription)  - Moisturizers  - Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids)    SYSTEMIC (BODY-WIDE) TREATMENTS  If you have very severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune system&apos;s faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids can also be used.  Newer drugs called biologics are used when other treatments do not work. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include:  - Adalimumab (Humira)  - Etanercept (Enbrel)  - Infliximab (Remicade)  - Ustekinumab (Stelara)  - Secukinumab (Cosentyx)  - Apremilast (Otezla)    PHOTOTHERAPY  Some people may choose to have phototherapy:  - This is treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light.  - It may be given alone or after you take a drug that makes the skin sensitive to light.  - Phototherapy for psoriasis can be given as ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light.   OTHER TREATMENTS  If you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics.  HOME CARE  Following these tips at home may help:   - Taking a daily bath or shower. Try not to scrub too hard because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack.  - Oatmeal baths may be soothing and may help to loosen scales. You can use over-the-counter oatmeal bath products. Or, you can mix 1 cup of oatmeal into a tub of warm water.  - Keeping your skin clean and moist, and avoiding your specific psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups.  - Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburned.  - Relaxation and anti-stress techniques. The link between stress and flares of psoriasis is not well understood.  - Limiting the alcoholic beverages you drink may help keep psoriasis from getting worse.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q78-S1-A2" pairid="184">The goals of psoriasis treatment are to change the course of the disease by interfering with the increased production of skin cells, and to remove scales and smooth rough skin. There are many types of treatments. Many are medicines and other treatments your doctor will have to prescribe. But there are other types of treatments you can buy without a prescription or try on your own. Some treatments for psoriasis are applied directly to the skin. Some use light to treat skin lesions. Others are taken by mouth or injected. This chapter focuses on treatments that are applied directly to the skin -- also called topical treatments or light therapy.  Topical Treatments Here are some different types of topical treatments for psoriasis. - helps soften and loosen skin scales  - comes as a cream, lotion, liquid, gel, ointment or shampoo. helps soften and loosen skin scales comes as a cream, lotion, liquid, gel, ointment or shampoo. - reduce inflammation and slow the growth and build-up of skin cells   - are used in different strengths for different parts of the body.  reduce inflammation and slow the growth and build-up of skin cells are used in different strengths for different parts of the body. - works by slowing the production of skin cells   - is often combined with a steroid for added effects   - may be used with UVB light.  works by slowing the production of skin cells is often combined with a steroid for added effects may be used with UVB light. - is used to treat long-term psoriasis and hard-to-treat plaques  - reduces inflammation   - slows down the growth of skin cells. is used to treat long-term psoriasis and hard-to-treat plaques reduces inflammation slows down the growth of skin cells. - cause the skin to shed dead cells  - slow the growth of skin cells   - decrease itching.  cause the skin to shed dead cells slow the growth of skin cells decrease itching. - are believed to work by reducing skin cell overgrowth  - decrease inflammation  - are often used with other treatments.  are believed to work by reducing skin cell overgrowth decrease inflammation are often used with other treatments. - slow down the growth of skin cells   - may be used with steroid creams for added effects.  slow down the growth of skin cells may be used with steroid creams for added effects. Regardless of the topical medication your doctor prescribes, it is important to follow directions carefully. Some can be messy and stain your clothing and bedding. Others can have potentially dangerous side effects. Light Therapy Light therapy, also called phototherapy, uses ultraviolet light to treat skin lesions. Laser therapy delivers intense, focused doses of light to specific areas of the skin to clear lesions without harming surrounding tissues. Here are some different kinds of light therapy. UVB phototherapy - penetrates the skin to slow the growth of affected cells   - is given at home or at the doctor’s office   - may be combined with topical treatments or injected or oral medicines to increase effectiveness. penetrates the skin to slow the growth of affected cells is given at home or at the doctor’s office may be combined with topical treatments or injected or oral medicines to increase effectiveness.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q78-S1-A3" pairid="185">While many psoriasis treatments are applied directly to the skin, your doctor may prescribe others that must be taken by mouth or injected. There are also some natural treatments, taken by mouth or applied to the skin, that you can try on your own. Systemic Therapies These therapies, prescribed by your doctor, work in different ways to help control the underlying disease process. It is important to learn as much as you can about these medications and to take them exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Oral or injected medications for psoriasis include the following. - is used to treat severe psoriasis (meaning more than 20 percent of skin is affected)  - slows the rapid growth of skin cells  - is taken by mouth or injected.  is used to treat severe psoriasis (meaning more than 20 percent of skin is affected) slows the rapid growth of skin cells is taken by mouth or injected. - may be used for severe psoriasis not controlled by methotrexate  - suppresses overactive T cells that play a role in psoriasis  - is taken by mouth or injected. may be used for severe psoriasis not controlled by methotrexate suppresses overactive T cells that play a role in psoriasis is taken by mouth or injected. - are man-made drugs related to vitamin A   - help slow the production of skin cells  - reduce inflammation. are man-made drugs related to vitamin A help slow the production of skin cells reduce inflammation. - are made from living cells grown in a laboratory  - block the action of specific cells and proteins that play a role in psoriasis  - must be injected beneath the skin or given intravenously (by IV). are made from living cells grown in a laboratory block the action of specific cells and proteins that play a role in psoriasis must be injected beneath the skin or given intravenously (by IV). Natural Treatments For many people, natural treatments can help relieve the symptoms of psoriasis. There are many natural treatments you can try on your own, but you should never use them to replace the treatment your doctor prescribes. Here are some natural treatments you may want to try. Spending a few minutes in the summer sun can help your psoriasis, but be sure to use sun block and increase time spent in the sun gradually. Applying cream from the aloe vera plant improves symptoms for some people. You should avoid aloe vera tablets. Taking fish oil orally helps some people with psoriasis. If you want to try fish oil, first speak with your doctor, as it may interact with other medications you are taking. Soaking in a solution of Dead Sea salts may improve scaling and itching. Be sure to apply moisturizer when you get out of the tub. Capsaicin, the ingredient that makes cayenne peppers hot, is the active ingredient in some topical pain-relievers. Some people find they relieve pain and itching.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q79-S1-A1" pairid="186">Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the ATM gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  About 1 percent of the United States population carries one mutated copy and one normal copy of the ATM gene in each cell. These individuals are called carriers. Although ATM mutation carriers do not have ataxia-telangiectasia, they are more likely than people without an ATM mutation to develop cancer; female carriers are particularly at risk for developing breast cancer. Carriers of a mutation in the ATM gene also may have an increased risk of heart disease.</ANSWER>

It can happen during both the day and night, although sleep-related bruxism is often a bigger problem because it is harder to control.  There is some disagreement about the cause of bruxism. Daily stress may be the trigger in many people. Some people probably clench their teeth and never feel symptoms.   Factors that influence whether or not bruxism causes pain and other problems will vary from person to person. They may include:   -  How much stress you are under   -  How long and tightly you clench and grind   -  Whether your teeth are misaligned   -  Your posture   -  Your ability to relax   -  Your diet   -  Your sleeping habits</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q80-S2-A1" pairid="188">Bruxism (BRUK-siz-um) is a condition in which you grind, gnash or clench your teeth. If you have bruxism, you may unconsciously clench your teeth together during the day, or clench or grind them at night (sleep bruxism).  Sleep bruxism is considered a sleep-related movement disorder. People who clench or grind their teeth (brux) during sleep are more likely to have other sleep disorders, such as snoring and pauses in breathing (sleep apnea).  Mild bruxism may not require treatment. However, in some people, bruxism can be frequent and severe enough to lead to jaw disorders, headaches, damaged teeth and other problems.  Because you may have sleep bruxism and be unaware of it until complications develop, it's important to know the signs and symptoms of bruxism and to seek regular dental care.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q81-S1-A1" pairid="192">Secondary Insomnia                  Secondary insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem. This type of insomnia often is a symptom of an emotional, neurological, or other medical or sleep disorder.                  Emotional disorders that can cause insomnia include depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Alzheimer&apos;s disease and Parkinson&apos;s disease are examples of neurological disorders that can cause insomnia.                  Many other disorders or factors also can cause insomnia, such as:                  Conditions that cause chronic (ongoing) pain, such as arthritis and headache disorders                  Conditions that make it hard to breathe, such as asthma and heart failure                  An overactive thyroid                  Gastrointestinal disorders, such as heartburn                  Stroke                  Sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep-related breathing problems                  Menopause and hot flashes                  Secondary insomnia also can be a side effect of some medicines. For example, certain asthma medicines, such as theophylline, and some allergy and cold medicines can cause insomnia. Beta blockers also can cause the condition. These medicines are used to treat heart conditions.                  Commonly used substances also can cause insomnia. Examples include caffeine and other stimulants, tobacco and other nicotine products, and alcohol and other sedatives.                  Primary Insomnia                  Primary insomnia isn&apos;t a symptom or side effect of another medical condition. It is its own distinct disorder, and its cause isn’t well understood. Primary insomnia usually lasts for at least 1 month.                  Many life changes can trigger primary insomnia. It may be due to major or long-lasting stress or emotional upset. Travel or other factors, such as work schedules that disrupt your sleep routine, also may trigger primary insomnia.                  Even if these issues are resolved, the insomnia may not go away. Trouble sleeping can persist because of habits formed to deal with the lack of sleep. These habits might include taking naps, worrying about sleep, and going to bed early.                  Researchers continue to try to find out whether some people are born with an increased risk for primary insomnia.</ANSWER>

Infants with this condition often have a high-pitched cry that sounds like that of a cat. The disorder is characterized by intellectual disability and delayed development, small head size (microcephaly), low birth weight, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia) in infancy. Affected individuals also have distinctive facial features, including widely set eyes (hypertelorism), low-set ears, a small jaw, and a rounded face.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q86-S1-A1" pairid="206">Treatment depends on many things, including the stage of the cancer. Treatments may include:  - Surgery to remove the tumor  - Chemotherapy to kill cancer cells  - Radiation therapy to destroy cancerous tissue  - Targeted therapy to keep cancer from growing and spreading    Surgery  Stage 0 colon cancer may be treated by removing the tumor. This is done using colonoscopy. For stages I, II, and III cancer, more extensive surgery is needed to remove the part of the colon that is cancerous. This surgery is called colon resection (colectomy).  Chemotherapy  Almost all people with stage III colon cancer receive chemotherapy after surgery for 6 to 8 months. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy. Even though the tumor was removed, chemotherapy is given to treat any cancer cells that may be left.  Chemotherapy is also used to improve symptoms and prolong survival in people with stage IV colon cancer.  You may receive just one type of medicine or a combination of medicines.   Radiation  Radiation therapy is sometimes used for colon cancer. It is usually used in combination with chemotherapy for people with stage III rectal cancer.  For people with stage IV disease that has spread to the liver, treatment directed at the liver can be used. This may include:  - Burning the cancer (ablation)  - Delivering chemotherapy or radiation directly into the liver  - Freezing the cancer (cryotherapy)  - Surgery   Targeted Therapy  - Targeted treatment zeroes in on specific targets (molecules) in cancer cells. These targets play a role in how cancer cells grow and survive. Using these targets, the drug disables the cancer cells so they cannot spread. Targeted therapy may be given as pills or may be injected into a vein.  - You may have targeted therapy along with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation treatment.  </ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q87-S2-A1" pairid="208">Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a condition in which there is an extra electrical pathway of the heart. The condition can lead to periods of rapid heart rate (tachycardia).  Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is one of the most common causes of fast heart rate problems in infants and children.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q87-S2-A2" pairid="209">Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a condition characterized by abnormal electrical pathways in the heart that cause a disruption of the heart&apos;s normal rhythm (arrhythmia).  The heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. A specialized cluster of cells called the atrioventricular node conducts electrical impulses from the heart&apos;s upper chambers (the atria) to the lower chambers (the ventricles). Impulses move through the atrioventricular node during each heartbeat, stimulating the ventricles to contract slightly later than the atria.  People with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome are born with an extra connection in the heart, called an accessory pathway, that allows electrical signals to bypass the atrioventricular node and move from the atria to the ventricles faster than usual. The accessory pathway may also transmit electrical impulses abnormally from the ventricles back to the atria. This extra connection can disrupt the coordinated movement of electrical signals through the heart, leading to an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) and other arrhythmias. Resulting symptoms include dizziness, a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), shortness of breath, and fainting (syncope). In rare cases, arrhythmias associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death. The most common arrhythmia associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.  Complications of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can occur at any age, although some individuals born with an accessory pathway in the heart never experience any health problems associated with the condition.  Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome often occurs with other structural abnormalities of the heart or underlying heart disease. The most common heart defect associated with the condition is Ebstein anomaly, which affects the valve that allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle (the tricuspid valve). Additionally, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can be a component of several other genetic syndromes, including hypokalemic periodic paralysis (a condition that causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness), Pompe disease (a disorder characterized by the storage of excess glycogen), and tuberous sclerosis (a condition that results in the growth of noncancerous tumors in many parts of the body).</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q88-S1-A1" pairid="210">A stroke is a medical emergency. Quick treatment is needed. Call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the first signs of a stroke.   People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible.   - If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting drug may be given to dissolve the clot.  - To be effective, this treatment must be started within 3 to 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms first started. The sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome.    Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include:   - Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix)  - Medicine to control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol  - Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes  - Nutrients and fluids    Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed.  The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes.   Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehabilitation center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center. Be sure to follow up with your health care provider after you go home.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q88-S1-A2" pairid="211">Generally there are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after the stroke, and post-stroke rehabilitation. Therapies to prevent a first or recurrent stroke are based on treating an individual&apos;s underlying risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes. Acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot causing an ischemic stroke or by stopping the bleeding of a hemorrhagic stroke. Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage. Medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke. The most popular classes of drugs used to prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) and thrombolytics.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q88-S1-A3" pairid="212">With stroke, treatment depends on the stage of the disease. There are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after stroke, and rehabilitation after stroke. Stroke treatments include medications, surgery, and rehabilitation.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q88-S1-A4" pairid="213">Medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke. The most popular kinds of drugs to prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics -- which include antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants -- and thrombolytics. Antithrombotics prevent the formation of blood clots that can become stuck in an artery of the brain and cause strokes. - In the case of stroke, doctors prescribe antiplatelet drugs mainly for prevention. The most widely known and used antiplatelet drug is aspirin. Other antiplatelet drugs include clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and dipyridamole.  In the case of stroke, doctors prescribe antiplatelet drugs mainly for prevention. The most widely known and used antiplatelet drug is aspirin. Other antiplatelet drugs include clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and dipyridamole. - Anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by reducing the clotting property of the blood. The most commonly used oral anticoagulants include warfarin, also known as Coumadin®, dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto). Injectable anticoagulants include heparin, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and dalteparin (Fragmin).  Anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by reducing the clotting property of the blood. The most commonly used oral anticoagulants include warfarin, also known as Coumadin®, dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto). Injectable anticoagulants include heparin, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and dalteparin (Fragmin). Thrombolytic drugs halt the stroke by dissolving the blood clot that is blocking blood flow to the brain. Ischemic strokes -- the most common kind -- can be treated with thrombolytic drugs. But a person needs to be at the hospital as soon as possible after symptoms start to be evaluated and receive treatment. A thrombolytic drug known as t-PA can be effective if a person receives it intravenously (in a vein) within 3 hours after his or her stroke symptoms have started. Because there is such a narrow time window for giving t-PA, it is important to note the time any stroke symptoms appear. Since thrombolytic drugs can increase bleeding, t-PA should be used only after the doctor is certain that the patient has suffered an ischemic and not a hemorrhagic stroke. Neuroprotectants are medications or other treatments that protect the brain from secondary injury caused by stroke. Although the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has not approved any neuroprotectants for use in stroke at this time, many have been tested or are being tested in clinical trials. Cooling of the brain (hypothermia) is beneficial for improving neurological function after a cardiac arrest.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q88-S1-A5" pairid="214">Surgery can be used to prevent stroke, to treat stroke, or to repair damage to the blood vessels or malformations in and around the brain. - Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure in which a surgeon removes fatty deposits, or plaque, from the inside of one of the carotid arteries. The procedure is performed to prevent stroke. The carotid arteries are located in the neck and are the main suppliers of blood to the brain.  Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure in which a surgeon removes fatty deposits, or plaque, from the inside of one of the carotid arteries. The procedure is performed to prevent stroke. The carotid arteries are located in the neck and are the main suppliers of blood to the brain. Vascular Interventions In addition to surgery, a variety of techniques have been developed to allow certain vascular problems to be treated from inside the artery using specialized catheters with the goal of improving blood flow. (Vascular is a word that refers to blood vessels, arteries, and veins that carry blood throughout the body.) A catheter is a very thin, flexible tube that can be inserted into one of the major arteries of the leg or arm and then directed through the blood vessels to the diseased artery. Physicians trained in this technique called angiography undergo additional training to treat problems in the arteries of the brain or spinal cord. These physicians are called neurointerventionalists. - Angioplasty is widely used by angiographers to open blocked heart arteries, and is also used to prevent stroke. Angioplasty is a procedure in which a special catheter is inserted into the narrowed artery and then a balloon at the tip of the catheter is inflated to open the blocked artery. The procedure improves blood flow to the brain. Angioplasty is widely used by angiographers to open blocked heart arteries, and is also used to prevent stroke. Angioplasty is a procedure in which a special catheter is inserted into the narrowed artery and then a balloon at the tip of the catheter is inflated to open the blocked artery. The procedure improves blood flow to the brain. - Stenting is another procedure used to prevent stroke. In this procedure an angiographer inserts a catheter into the artery in the groin and then positions the tip of the catheter inside the narrowed artery. A stent is a tube-like device made of a mesh-like material that can be slipped into position over the catheter. When positioned inside the narrowed segment the stent is expanded to widen the artery and the catheter is removed. Angioplasty or stenting of the carotid artery can cause pieces of the diseased plaque to loosen. An umbrella-like device is often temporarily expanded above to prevent these pieces from traveling to the brain. Stenting is another procedure used to prevent stroke.

One device involves threading a catheter through the artery to the site of the blockage and then vacuuming out the clot. Another corkscrew-like device can be extended from the tip of a catheter and used to grab the clot and pull it out. Drugs can also be injected through the catheter directly into the clot to help dissolve the clot.

Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.     Try using over-the-counter or custom heel wedges in your shoe to help decrease stress on the heel.     Try ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation.   Have physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back.  If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture).  If the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q90-S1-A1" pairid="217">Williams syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. This condition is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning problems, unique personality characteristics, distinctive facial features, and heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems.  People with Williams syndrome typically have difficulty with visual-spatial tasks such as drawing and assembling puzzles, but they tend to do well on tasks that involve spoken language, music, and learning by repetition (rote memorization). Affected individuals have outgoing, engaging personalities and tend to take an extreme interest in other people. Attention deficit disorder (ADD), problems with anxiety, and phobias are common among people with this disorder.  Young children with Williams syndrome have distinctive facial features including a broad forehead, a short nose with a broad tip, full cheeks, and a wide mouth with full lips. Many affected people have dental problems such as teeth that are small, widely spaced, crooked, or missing. In older children and adults, the face appears longer and more gaunt.  A form of cardiovascular disease called supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) occurs frequently in people with Williams syndrome. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). If this condition is not treated, the aortic narrowing can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart failure. Other problems with the heart and blood vessels, including high blood pressure (hypertension), have also been reported in people with Williams syndrome.  Additional signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome include abnormalities of connective tissue (tissue that supports the body&apos;s joints and organs) such as joint problems and soft, loose skin. Affected people may also have increased calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia) in infancy, developmental delays, problems with coordination, and short stature. Medical problems involving the eyes and vision, the digestive tract, and the urinary system are also possible.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q90-S1-A2" pairid="218">Williams Syndrome (WS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by mild to moderate delays in cognitive development or learning difficulties, a distinctive facial appearance, and a unique personality that combines over-friendliness and high levels of empathy with anxiety. The most significant medical problem associated with WS is cardiovascular disease caused by narrowed arteries. WS is also associated with elevated blood calcium levels in infancy. A random genetic mutation (deletion of a small piece of chromosome 7), rather than inheritance, most often causes the disorder.  However, individuals who have WS have a 50 percent chance of passing it on if they decide to have children.  The characteristic facial features of WS include puffiness around the eyes, a short nose with a broad nasal tip, wide mouth, full cheeks, full lips, and a small chin. People with WS are also likely to have a long neck, sloping shoulders, short stature, limited mobility in their joints, and curvature of the spine.  Some individuals with WS have a star-like pattern in the iris of their eyes.  Infants with WS are often irritable and colicky, with feeding problems that keep them from gaining weight.  Chronic abdominal pain is common in adolescents and adults. By age 30, the majority of individuals with WS have diabetes or pre-diabetes and mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss (a form of deafness due to disturbed function of the auditory nerve).  For some people, hearing loss may begin as early as late childhood. WS also is associated with a characteristic “cognitive profile” of mental strengths and weaknesses composed of strengths in verbal short-term memory and language, combined with severe weakness in visuospatial construction (the skills used to copy patterns, draw, or write). Within language, the strongest skills are typically in concrete, practical vocabulary, which in many cases is in the low average to average range for the general population. Abstract or conceptual-relational vocabulary is much more limited. Most older children and adults with WS speak fluently and use good grammar.  More than 50% of children with WS have attention deficit disorders (ADD or ADHD), and about 50% have specific phobias, such as a fear of loud noises. The majority of individuals with WS worry excessively. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), have funded many of the research studies exploring the genetic and neurobiological origins of WS.  In the early 1990s, researchers located and identified the genetic mutation responsible for the disorder: the deletion of a small section of chromosome 7 that contains approximately 25 genes.  NINDS continues to support WS researchers including, for example, groups that are attempting to link specific genes with the corresponding facial, cognitive, personality, and neurological characteristics of WS.</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q93-S1-A1" pairid="227">Initial Treatment  Celexa (citalopram HBr) should be administered at an initial dose of 20 mg once daily, generally with an increase to a dose of 40 mg/day. Dose increases should usually occur in increments of 20 mg at intervals of no less than one week. Although certain patients may require a dose of 60 mg/day, the only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an advantage for the 60 mg/day dose over the 40 mg/day dose; doses above 40 mg are therefore not ordinarily recommended.  Celexa should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food. Special Populations  20 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment, with titration to 40 mg/day only for nonresponding patients.  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Celexa should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester  Neonates exposed to Celexa and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see PRECAUTIONS). When treating pregnant women with Celexa during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. The physician may consider tapering Celexa in the third trimester. Maintenance Treatment  It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Systematic evaluation of Celexa in two studies has shown that its antidepressant efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 6 or 8 weeks of initial treatment (32 weeks total). In one study, patients were assigned randomly to placebo or to the same dose of Celexa (20-60 mg/day) during maintenance treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, while in the other study, patients were assigned randomly to continuation of Celexa 20 or 40 mg/day, or placebo, for maintenance treatment. In the latter study, the rates of relapse to depression were similar for the two dose groups (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Based on these limited data, it is not known whether the dose of citalopram needed to maintain euthymia is identical to the dose needed to induce remission. If adverse reactions are bothersome, a decrease in dose to 20 mg/day can be considered. Discontinuation of Treatment with Celexa  Symptoms associated with discontinuation of Celexa and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Switching Patients To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor  At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI and initiation of Celexa therapy.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q94-S1-A1" pairid="228">If ADHD is suspected, the person should be evaluated by a health care professional. There is no test that can make or exclude a diagnosis of ADHD. The diagnosis is based on a pattern of the symptoms listed below. When the person with suspected ADHD is a child, parents and teachers are usually involved during the evaluation process.  Most children with ADHD have at least one other developmental or mental health problem. This problem may be a mood, anxiety or substance use disorder; a learning disability; or a tic disorder. A doctor can help determine whether these other conditions are present. Symptoms  ADHD symptoms fall into three groups:    Not being able to focus (inattentiveness)  Being extremely active (hyperactivity)  Not being able to control behavior (impulsivity)  Some people with ADHD have mainly inattentive symptoms. Some have mainly hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. Others have a combination of these behaviors.    INATTENTIVE SYMPTOMS    Doesn't pay attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork  Has problems focusing during tasks or play  Doesn't listen when spoken to directly  Doesn't follow through on instructions and doesn't finish schoolwork or chores  Has problems organizing tasks and activities  Avoids or doesn't like tasks that require mental effort (such as schoolwork)  Often loses things, such as homework or toys  Is easily distracted  Is often forgetful  HYPERACTIVITY SYMPTOMS    Fidgets or squirms in seat  Leaves their seat when they should stay in their seat  Runs about or climbs when they shouldn't be doing so  Has problems playing or working quietly  Is often "on the go," acts as if "driven by a motor"  Talks all the time  IMPULSIVITY SYMPTOMS    Blurts out answers before questions have been completed  Has problems awaiting their turn  Interrupts or intrudes on others (butts into conversations or games)  Many of the above findings are present in children as they grow. For these problems to be diagnosed as ADHD, they must be out of the normal range for a person's age and development.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q95-S1-A1" pairid="229">There is no known cure for MS at this time. But, there are treatments that may slow the disease. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms and help you maintain a normal quality of life.  Medicines are often taken long-term. These include:  - Medicines to slow the disease  - Steroids to decrease the severity of attacks  - Medicines to control symptoms such as muscle spasms, urinary problems, fatigue, or mood problems    Medicines are more effective for the relapsing-remitting form than for other forms of MS.  The following may also be helpful for people with MS:  - Physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and support groups  - Assistive devices, such as wheelchairs, bed lifts, shower chairs, walkers, and wall bars  - A planned exercise program early in the course of the disorder  - A healthy lifestyle, with good nutrition and enough rest and relaxation  - Avoiding fatigue, stress, temperature extremes, and illness  - Changes in what you eat or drink if there are swallowing problems  - Making changes around the home to prevent falls  - Social workers or other counseling services to help you cope with the disorder and get assistance  - Vitamin D or other supplements (talk to your provider first)  - Complementary and alternative approaches, such as acupressure or cannabis, to help with muscle problems</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q95-S1-A3" pairid="231">There is as yet no cure for MS. Many patients do well with no therapy at all, especially since many medications have serious side effects and some carry significant risks.  However, three forms of beta interferon (Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif) have now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe.  The FDA also has approved a synthetic form of myelin basic protein, called copolymer I (Copaxone), for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. Copolymer I has few side effects, and studies indicate that the agent can reduce the relapse rate by almost one third.  Other FDA approved drugs to treat relapsing forms of MS in adults include teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate.  An immunosuppressant treatment, Novantrone (mitoxantrone), is approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced or chronic MS.  The FDA has also approved dalfampridine (Ampyra) to improve walking in individuals with MS.                  One monoclonal antibody, natalizumab (Tysabri), was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce the frequency of attacks in people with relapsing forms of MS and was approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004.  However, in 2005 the drug’s manufacturer voluntarily suspended marketing of the drug after several reports of significant adverse events.  In 2006, the FDA again approved sale of the drug for MS but under strict treatment guidelines involving infusion centers where patients can be monitored by specially trained physicians.                   While steroids do not affect the course of MS over time, they can reduce the duration and severity of attacks in some patients.  Spasticity, which can occur either as a sustained stiffness caused by increased muscle tone or as spasms that come and go, is usually treated with muscle relaxants and tranquilizers such as baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam, clonazepam, and dantrolene. Physical therapy and exercise can help preserve remaining function, and patients may find that various aids -- such as foot braces, canes, and walkers -- can help them remain independent and mobile.  Avoiding excessive activity and avoiding heat are probably the most important measures patients can take to counter physiological fatigue.  If psychological symptoms of fatigue such as depression or apathy are evident, antidepressant medications may help.  Other drugs that may reduce fatigue in some, but not all, patients include amantadine (Symmetrel), pemoline (Cylert), and the still-experimental drug aminopyridine. Although improvement of optic symptoms usually occurs even without treatment, a short course of treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) followed by treatment with oral steroids is sometimes used.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q99-S1-A1" pairid="236">Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder.  It is characterized by involuntary and rhythmic shaking (tremor), especially in the hands, without any other signs or symptoms. It is distinguished from tremor that results from other disorders or known causes, such as tremors seen with Parkinson disease or head trauma. Most cases of essential tremor are hereditary. There are five forms of essential tremor that are based on different genetic causes. Several genes as well as lifestyle and environmental factors likely play a role in a person&apos;s risk of developing this complex condition. In mild cases, treatment may not be necessary. In cases where symptoms interfere with daily living, medications may help to relieve symptoms.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q99-S1-A2" pairid="237">Essential tremor is a movement disorder that causes involuntary, rhythmic shaking (tremor), especially in the hands. It is distinguished from tremor that results from other disorders or known causes, such as Parkinson disease or head trauma. Essential tremor usually occurs alone, without other neurological signs or symptoms. However, some experts think that essential tremor can include additional features, such as mild balance problems.  Essential tremor usually occurs with movements and can occur during many different types of activities, such as eating, drinking, or writing. Essential tremor can also occur when the muscles are opposing gravity, such as when the hands are extended. It is usually not evident at rest.  In addition to the hands and arms, muscles of the trunk, face, head, and neck may also exhibit tremor in this disorder; the legs and feet are less often involved. Head tremor may appear as a &quot;yes-yes&quot; or &quot;no-no&quot; movement while the affected individual is seated or standing. In some people with essential tremor, the tremor may affect the voice (vocal tremor).  Essential tremor does not shorten the lifespan. However, it may interfere with fine motor skills such as using eating utensils, writing, shaving, or applying makeup, and in some cases these and other activities of daily living can be greatly impaired. Symptoms of essential tremor may be aggravated by emotional stress, anxiety, fatigue, hunger, caffeine, cigarette smoking, or temperature extremes.  Essential tremor may appear at any age but is most common in the elderly. Some studies have suggested that people with essential tremor have a higher than average risk of developing neurological conditions including Parkinson disease or sensory problems such as hearing loss, especially in individuals whose tremor appears after age 65.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q99-S2-A1" pairid="238">Treatment may not be needed unless the tremors interfere with your daily activities or cause embarrassment.  HOME CARE  For tremors made worse by stress, try techniques that help you relax. For tremors of any cause, avoid caffeine and get enough sleep.  For tremors caused or made worse by a medication, talk to your doctor about stopping the drug, reducing the dosage, or switching. Do not change or stop medications on your own.  Severe tremors make it harder to do daily activities. You may need help with these activities. Things that can help include:  - Buying clothes with Velcro fasteners, or using button hooks  - Cooking or eating with utensils that have a larger handle  - Using straws to drink  - Wearing slip-on shoes and using shoehorns    MEDICINES FOR TREMOR  Medicines may help relieve symptoms. The most commonly used drugs include:  - Propranolol, a beta blocker  - Primidone, a drug used to treat seizures    These drugs can have side effects.  - Propranolol may cause fatigue, stuffy nose, or slow heartbeat, and it may make asthma worse.  - Primidone may cause drowsiness, problems concentrating, nausea, and problems with walking, balance, and coordination.    Other medications that may reduce tremors include:  - Antiseizure drugs  - Mild tranquilizers  - Blood pressure drugs called calcium-channel blockers    Botox injections given in the hand may be tried to reduce tremors.  SURGERY  In severe cases, surgery may be tried. This may include:  - Focusing high-powered x-rays on a small area of the brain (stereotactic radiosurgery)  - Implanting a stimulating device in the brain to signal the area that controls movement</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q99-S2-A2" pairid="239">Treatment for essential tremor may not be necessary unless the tremors interfere with daily activities or cause embarrassment. Although there is no definitive cure for essential tremor, medicines may help relieve symptoms. How well medicines work depend on the individual patient. Two medications used to treat tremors include: Propranolol, a drug that blocks the action of stimulating substances called neurotransmitters, particularly those related to adrenaline Primidone, an antiseizure drug that also control the function of some neurotransmitters These drugs can have significant side effects. Eliminating tremor &quot;triggers&quot; such as caffeine and other stimulants from the diet is often recommended. Physical therapy may help to reduce tremor and improve coordination and muscle control for some patients.   More details about the management of essential tremor can be accessed through the following web links: http://www.mayoclinic.com/print/essential-tremor/DS00367/METHOD=print&amp;DSECTION=all  http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1150290-treatment</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q99-S2-A4" pairid="241">There is no definitive cure for essential tremor. Symptomatic drug therapy may include propranolol or other beta blockers and primidone, an anticonvulsant drug. Eliminating tremor &quot;triggers&quot; such as caffeine and other stimulants from the diet is often recommended. Physical and occupational therapy may help to reduce tremor and improve coordination and muscle control for some individuals.  Deep brain stimulation uses a surgically implanted, battery-operated medical device called a neurostimulator to delivery electrical stimulation to targeted areas of the brain that control movement, temporarily blocking the nerve signals that cause tremor.  Other surgical intervention is effective but may have side effects.</ANSWER>

Caffeine can dry out the mouth. Don&apos;t use tobacco or alcohol. They dry out the mouth. Gene Therapy Research for Salivary Gland Dysfunction Scientists at NIH’s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction. The idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with Sjögren&apos;s syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment. The hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions. NIDCR recently completed a clinical study, a research study in humans, on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands. The study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth. Read NIDCR’s news release  to learn more about the study’s findings. Based on the promising results of this trial, similar clinical trials are planned in the near future. Research on Sjögren’s Syndrome and Other Diseases Affecting Salivary Glands NIDCR is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome. Such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow. Other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes, auto inflammatory diseases, and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction. Such studies could one day lead to better ways of preventing and treating salivary gland conditions. To stay abreast of any new studies on gene therapy and salivary gland function, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  ClinicalTrials.gov lists all federally and many privately funded clinical trials in the U.S. and around the world; the web site is updated frequently.</ANSWER>

DNA is the chemical that carries the instructions for nearly everything our cells do. We usually look like our parents because they are the source of our DNA. However, DNA affects more than the way we look.  Some genes (parts of DNA) control a cell’s growth and division process. Genes that promote cell division are called oncogenes. Other genes called tumor suppressor genes can slow down cell division or even make cells die at an appropriate time. Cancers can be caused by DNA mutations (gene defects) that turn on oncogenes or turn off tumor suppressor genes.  In some diseases, mutations may be passed down from a parent. Inherited mutations do not seem to cause CMML. Instead, the mutations are acquired during the person’s lifetime. Exposure to radiation or cancer-causing chemicals can cause mutations that lead to CMML. Sometimes these gene changes occur for no apparent reason. Every time a cell prepares to divide into 2 new cells, it must copy its DNA. This process is not perfect, and copying errors can occur. Fortunately, cells have repair enzymes that read and fix DNA. However, some errors may slip past, especially if the cells are growing rapidly.  Human DNA is packaged in 23 pairs of chromosomes. In up to half of patients, CMML cells contain altered chromosomes. Sometimes part of one chromosome attaches to a different chromosome. This is called a translocation. Like mutations, translocations can turn on oncogenes or turn off tumor suppressor genes. Acquired translocations are seen in some cases of CMML. Another chromosome abnormality that can be seen in CMML is called a deletion. This involves the loss of all or part of a chromosome. Another type of chromosome abnormality is called a duplication. This is when there is an extra copy of all or part of a chromosome. </ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q103-S2-A1" pairid="249">People with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) may have questions about their prognosis and survival. Prognosis and survival depend on many factors. Only a doctor familiar with a person’s medical history, type of cancer, stage, characteristics of the cancer, treatments chosen and response to treatment can put all of this information together with survival statistics to arrive at a prognosis.  A prognosis is the doctor’s best estimate of how cancer will affect a person and how it will respond to treatment. A prognostic factor is an aspect of the cancer or a characteristic of the person that the doctor will consider when making a prognosis. A predictive factor influences how a cancer will respond to a certain treatment. Prognostic and predictive factors are often discussed together and they both play a part in deciding on a treatment plan and a prognosis.</ANSWER>

Most people diagnosed with leukemia are over 50 years old. Leukemia Starts in Bone Marrow Types of blood cells made by the bone marrow and a description of their functions. - Click to enlarge in new window. Click for more information  Leukemia usually begins in the bone marrow, the soft material in the center of most bones where blood cells are formed. The bone marrow makes three types of blood cells, and each type has a special function.      White blood cells fight infection and disease.     Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body.     Platelets help control bleeding by forming blood clots.  In people with leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells, called leukemia cells. At first, leukemia cells function almost normally. But over time, as more leukemia cells are produced, they may crowd out the healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This makes it difficult for the blood to carry out its normal functions.  There are four common types of adult leukemia. Two are chronic, meaning they get worse over a longer period of time. The other two are acute, meaning they get worse quickly.      chronic lymphocytic leukemia     chronic myeloid leukemia     acute myeloid leukemia     acute lymphocytic leukemia </ANSWER>

Click for more information  Even if blood tests suggest leukemia, the doctor may look for signs of leukemia in the bone marrow by doing a biopsy before making a diagnosis. A biopsy is a procedure where a small amount of bone marrow is removed from a bone. A pathologist examines the sample under a microscope to look for abnormal cells.  There are two ways the doctor can obtain bone marrow. In a bone marrow aspiration, marrow is collected by inserting a needle into the hipbone or another large bone and removing a small amount of bone marrow. A bone marrow biopsy is performed with a larger needle and removes bone marrow and a small piece of bone. If Leukemia Cells Are Found  If leukemia cells are found in the bone marrow sample, the doctor may perform more tests to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. The doctor may collect a sample of the fluid around the brain and spinal cord by performing a spinal tap and checking for leukemia cells or other signs of problems.  Computed tomography (CT) scans, and ultrasounds are tests used to determine if leukemia has spread from the bone marrow. These tests produce pictures of the inside of the body.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q103-S6-A1" pairid="253">There are many treatment options for people with leukemia. The choice of treatment depends on your age and general health, the type of leukemia you have, whether or not it has spread outside the bone marrow, and other factors. If tests show that you have leukemia, you should talk with your doctor and make treatment decisions as soon as possible, although many patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia do not require treatment for many years. Working With a Team of Specialists A team of specialists often treats people with leukemia. The team will keep the primary doctor informed about the patient&apos;s progress. The team may include a hematologist who is a specialist in blood and blood-forming tissues, a medical oncologist who is a specialist in cancer treatment, and a radiation oncologist who is a specialist in radiation therapy. Before starting treatment, you may want another doctor to review the diagnosis and treatment plan. Some insurance companies require a second opinion. Others may pay for a second opinion if you or your doctor requests it. Clinical Trials for Leukemia Some leukemia patients take part in studies of new treatments. These studies, called clinical trials, are designed to find out whether a new treatment is safe and effective and better than current treatments. Talk to your doctor if you are interested in taking part in a clinical trial. The U.S. National Institutes of Health, through its National Library of Medicine and other Institutes, maintains a database of clinical trials at ClinicalTrials.gov.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q103-S6-A2" pairid="254">Unlike other types of cancer, leukemia isn&apos;t a tumor that your doctor can surgically remove. Leukemia cells are produced in the bone marrow and travel throughout the body. The Goal of Treatment The goal of treatment for leukemia is to destroy the leukemia cells and allow normal cells to form in the bone marrow. Depending on the type and extent of the disease, patients may have chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiation therapy, or stem cell transplantation. Some patients receive a combination of treatments. Treatment depends on a number of factors, including the type of leukemia, the patient&apos;s age and general health, whether leukemia cells are present in the fluid around the brain or spinal cord, and whether the leukemia has been treated before. It also may depend on certain features of the leukemia cells and the patient&apos;s symptoms. Acute Leukemia or Chronic Leukemia? If a person has acute leukemia, they will need treatment right away. The purpose of treatment is to stop the rapid growth of leukemia cells and to bring about remission, meaning the cancer is under control. In many cases, a person will continue treatment after signs and symptoms disappear to prevent the disease from coming back. Some people with acute leukemia can be cured.  Learn more about treatments for acute myeloid leukemia.   Learn more about treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Chronic leukemia may not need to be treated until symptoms appear. Treatment can often control the disease and its symptoms. Types of Treatments Some, but not all, forms of treatment for leukemia include - chemotherapy  - biological therapy  -  radiation therapy.  chemotherapy biological therapy radiation therapy. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. This a common treatment for some types of leukemia. Chemotherapy may be taken by mouth in pill form, by injection directly into a vein, or through a catheter. If leukemia cells are found in the fluid around the brain or spinal cord, the doctor may inject drugs directly into the fluid to ensure that the drugs reach the leukemia cells in the brain. Biological Therapy Biological therapy uses special substances that improve the body&apos;s natural defenses against cancer. Some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia receive monoclonal antibodies, which are man-made proteins that can identify leukemia cells. Monoclonal antibodies bind to the cells and assist the body in killing them. Although monoclonal antibodies are being used to treat leukemia, researchers are studying more innovative ways to use them in treatment. Some antibodies are used alone to try to prompt the immune system to attack leukemia cells. Other antibodies are attached to substances that can deliver poison to cancer cells. These modified antibodies, called immunotoxins, deliver the toxins directly to the cancer cells. Lately, precision medicine trials have shown evidence that single targeted therapies taken in pill form can prolong survival. Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells. A machine outside the body directs high-energy beams at the spleen, the brain, or other parts of the body where leukemia cells have collected. Radiation therapy is used primarily to control disease in bones that are at risk of fracture or at sites that are causing pain.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q103-S6-A5" pairid="257">Researchers are studying various drugs, immunotherapies, and other types of treatments. Because leukemia is a complicated disease, researchers are also studying the effectiveness of using combinations of treatments. Following are a few examples of some areas of current research. The drug imatinib (Gleevec®) is important in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. However, imatinib stops working in some people with leukemia because the cells become resistant. Fortunately, two drugs, dasatinib (Sprycel®) and nilotinib (Tasigna®), are being used to treat people who stop responding to imatinib. Both are approved by the FDA for use in patients. These drugs work against the same abnormal protein targeted by imatinib, but in different ways. Gene therapy -- replacing, manipulating, or supplementing nonfunctional genes with healthy genes -- is being explored for treatment of leukemia. It is being studied as a way to stimulate a patient&apos;s immune system to kill leukemia cells and also to interfere with the production of proteins that cause cells to become cancerous.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q103-S7-A1" pairid="258">During the early stages of leukemia, there may be no symptoms. Many of the symptoms of leukemia don&apos;t become apparent until a large number of normal blood cells are crowded out by leukemia cells. Symptoms of Chronic and Acute Leukemia In chronic leukemia, symptoms develop gradually and, in the beginning, are generally not as severe as in acute leukemia. Chronic leukemia is usually found during a routine doctor&apos;s exam before symptoms are present. When symptoms appear, they generally are mild at first and gradually get worse, but sometimes they don&apos;t worsen until many years after an initial diagnosis. Recently, researchers discovered that abnormal white blood cells can be present in the blood of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients a number of years before a diagnosis. This finding may lead to a better understanding of the cellular changes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease and how the disease progresses. In acute leukemia, symptoms usually appear and get worse quickly. People with this disease usually go to their doctor because they feel sick. White Blood Cell Levels May Be High People with leukemia may have very high levels of white blood cells, but because the cells are abnormal, they are unable to fight infection. Therefore, patients may develop frequent fevers or infections. A shortage of red blood cells, called anemia, can cause a person to feel tired. Not having enough blood platelets may cause a person to bleed and bruise easily. Some symptoms depend on where leukemia cells collect in the body. Leukemia cells can collect in many different tissues and organs, such as the digestive tract, kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, or other parts of the body, including the eyes, brain, and testicles. Other Common Symptoms Other common symptoms of leukemia include headache, weight loss, pain in the bones or joints, swelling or discomfort in the abdomen (from an enlarged spleen), and swollen lymph nodes, especially in the neck or armpit. Symptoms of acute leukemia may include vomiting, confusion, loss of muscle control, and seizures. Some of the symptoms of leukemia are similar to those caused by the flu or other common diseases, so these symptoms are not sure signs of leukemia. It is important to check with your doctor if you have these symptoms. Only a doctor can diagnose and treat leukemia. Diagnosing Leukemia: Physical Exam, Blood Tests, Biopsy To find the cause of leukemia symptoms, the doctor will ask about medical history and conduct a physical exam.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q106-S1-A4" pairid="265">Choosing Treatment There are a number of ways to treat prostate cancer, and the doctor will develop a treatment to fit each man&apos;s needs. The choice of treatment mostly depends on the stage of the disease and the grade of the tumor. But doctors also consider a man&apos;s age, general health, and his feelings about the treatments and their possible side effects. Treatment for prostate cancer may involve watchful waiting, surgery, radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy. Some men receive a combination of therapies. A cure is the goal for men whose prostate cancer is diagnosed early. Weighing Treatment Options You and your doctor will want to consider both the benefits and possible side effects of each option, especially the effects on sexual activity and urination, and other concerns about quality of life. Surgery, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy all have the potential to disrupt sexual desire or performance for a short while or permanently. Discuss your concerns with your health care provider. Several options are available to help you manage sexual problems related to prostate cancer treatment. Watchful Waiting The doctor may suggest watchful waiting for some men who have prostate cancer that is found at an early stage and appears to be growing slowly. Also, watchful waiting may be advised for older men or men with other serious medical problems. For these men, the risks and possible side effects of surgery, radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy may outweigh the possible benefits. Doctors monitor these patients with regular check-ups. If symptoms appear or get worse, the doctor may recommend active treatment. Surgery Surgery is used to remove the cancer. It is a common treatment for early stage prostate cancer. The surgeon may remove the entire prostate with a type of surgery called radical prostatectomy or, in some cases, remove only part of it. Sometimes the surgeon will also remove nearby lymph nodes. Side effects of the operation may include lack of sexual function or impotence, or problems holding urine or incontinence. Improvements in surgery now make it possible for some men to keep their sexual function. In some cases, doctors can use a technique known as nerve-sparing surgery. This may save the nerves that control erection. However, men with large tumors or tumors that are very close to the nerves may not be able to have this surgery. Some men with trouble holding urine may regain control within several weeks of surgery. Others continue to have problems that require them to wear a pad. Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Doctors may recommend it instead of surgery, or after surgery, to destroy any cancer cells that may remain in the area. In advanced stages, the doctor may recommend radiation to relieve pain or other symptoms. It may also be used in combination with hormonal therapy. Radiation can cause problems with impotence and bowel function. The radiation may come from a machine, which is external radiation, or from tiny radioactive seeds placed inside or near the tumor, which is internal radiation. Men who receive only the radioactive seeds usually have small tumors. Some men receive both kinds of radiation therapy. For external radiation therapy, patients go to the hospital or clinic -- usually for several weeks. Internal radiation may require patients to stay in the hospital for a short time. Hormonal Therapy Hormonal therapy deprives cancer cells of the male hormones they need to grow and survive. This treatment is often used for prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Sometimes doctors use hormonal therapy to try to keep the cancer from coming back after surgery or radiation treatment. Side effects can include impotence, hot flashes, loss of sexual desire, and thinning of bones. Some hormone therapies increase the risk of blood clots. Monitoring Treatment Regardless of the type of treatment you receive, you will be closely monitored to see how well the treatment is working. Monitoring may include - a PSA blood test -- usually every 3 months to 1 year.  - bone scan and/or CT scan to see if the cancer has spread.  - a complete blood count to monitor for signs and symptoms of anemia.  - looking for signs or symptoms that the disease might be progressing, such as fatigue, increased pain, or decreased bowel and bladder function. a PSA blood test -- usually every 3 months to 1 year. bone scan and/or CT scan to see if the cancer has spread. a complete blood count to monitor for signs and symptoms of anemia. looking for signs or symptoms that the disease might be progressing, such as fatigue, increased pain, or decreased bowel and bladder function.</ANSWER>

Doctors are studying new ways of using radiation therapy and hormonal therapy, too. Studies have shown that hormonal therapy given after radiation therapy can help certain men whose cancer has spread to nearby tissues. Scientists are also testing the effectiveness of chemotherapy and biological therapy for men whose cancer does not respond or stops responding to hormonal therapy. They are also exploring new ways to schedule and combine various treatments. For example, they are studying hormonal therapy to find out if using it to shrink the tumor before a man has surgery or radiation might be a useful approach. They are also testing combinations of hormone therapy and vaccines to prevent recurrence of prostate cancer. In 2010, the FDA approved a therapeutic cancer vaccine, Provenge, for use in some men with metastatic prostate cancer. This approval was based on the results of a clinical trial that demonstrated a more than 4-month improvement in overall survival compared with a placebo vaccine. Other similar vaccine therapies are in development.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q108-S1-A1" pairid="272">CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE   An active lifestyle and plenty of exercise, along with healthy eating, is the safest way to lose weight. Even modest weight loss can improve your health. You may need a lot of support from family and friends.  Your main goal should be to learn new, healthy ways of eating and make them part of your daily routine.  Many people find it hard to change their eating habits and behaviors. You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle.  Work with your health care provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep them off. Your dietitian can teach you about:  - Healthy food choices  - Healthy snacks  - Reading nutrition labels  - New ways to prepare food  - Portion sizes  - Sweetened drinks    Extreme diets (fewer than 1,100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often do not contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again.  Learn ways to manage stress other than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your provider.    MEDICINES AND HERBAL REMEDIES   You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects. Talk to your provider before using them.  You can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor. Many people lose at least 5 pounds by taking these drugs, but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes.   SURGERY   Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain diseases in people with severe obesity. These risks include:  - Arthritis  - Diabetes  - Heart disease  - High blood pressure  - Sleep apnea  - Some cancers  - Stroke    Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine.  Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you.  Weight-loss surgeries include:  - Laparoscopic gastric banding  - Gastric bypass surgery  - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common)  - Duodenal switch</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q111-S1-A1" pairid="278">Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that involves muscle weakness, which quickly gets worse.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q111-S1-A2" pairid="279">Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rapidly progressive form of muscular dystrophy that occurs primarily in boys. It is caused by an alteration (mutation) in a gene, called the DMD gene that can be inherited in families in an X-linked recessive fashion, but it often occurs in people from families without a known family history of the condition. Individuals who have DMD have progressive loss of muscle function and weakness, which begins in the lower limbs. The DMD gene is the second largest gene to date, which encodes the muscle protein, dystrophin. Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy do not make the dystrophin protein in their muscles. Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects approximately 1 in 3500 male births worldwide. Because this is an inherited disorder, risks include a family history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q111-S2-A1" pairid="280">Duchenne muscular dystrophy is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Males have only one copy of the X chromosome from their mother and one copy of the Y chromosome from their father. If their X chromosome has a DMD gene mutation, they will have Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Females, on the other hand, have two copies of the X chromosomes.. Since females have two copies of this gene, if one copy does not work, they have a second back up copy to produce the dystrophin protein. A woman who has a genetic change in one of her two copies is said to be "a carrier" of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Carriers do not have Duchenne muscular dystrophy and most are unaware that they even carry this change in their genetic material unless they have a family history. However, recent studies have shown that some carrier females (approximately 20 percent) will show symptoms of DMD, including muscle weakness and cardiac abnormalities.  With an X-linked recessive condition, the chance of passing on the changed (non-working) copy of the gene to a child is different for males and females.  Females who carry the changed copy of the gene have a 50 percent chance of passing it on with each pregnancy. Thus, there is a 25 percent chance of having a affected child with DMD (eg., 50 percent of boys have the chance of having DMD and 50 percent of girls will be carriers). The chance of a woman who has one affected son (and no family history) of being a carrier of the changed DMD gene is approximately 2/3. However, in the remaining third of individuals with DMD, the change in the dystrophin gene is a new genetic change, or de novo change and about 10 percent of new mutations are due to gonadal mosaicism. Gonadal mosaicism refers to a condition where an individual has two or more cell populations that differ in genetic makeup in their eggs or sperm.  Males who inherit or are born with a changed copy of the DMD gene will have DMD since they have a Y chromosome, and do not have back-up X chromosome. If a male with DMD were to have children, all of his daughters would be carriers and none of his sons would be affected.  Currently various reproductive options are available to families. The preconception options include MicroSort which is a technology that can separate sperm containing X chromosomes allowing for an increase in chances of having a female. The second reproductive option is preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which is a technique that can allow the cells of a fertilized egg to be tested to determine if it contains a change in the DMD gene and then implant those eggs which do not. The post conception options include Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis which analyze sampled cells derived from the developing fetus.  Several of the prenatal testing options for pregnancies at increased risk are available when the DMD disease-causing mutation has been identified in a family member, or if informative, genetically-linked markers have been identified.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q111-S3-A1" pairid="281">Symptoms usually appear before age 6 and may appear as early as infancy.   They may include:  - Fatigue  - Learning difficulties (the IQ can be below 75)   - Intellectual disability (possible, but does not get worse over time)   Muscle weakness:  - Begins in the legs and pelvis, but also occurs less severely in the arms, neck, and other areas of the body  - Problems with motor skills (running, hopping, jumping)  - Frequent falls  - Trouble getting up from a lying position or climbing stairs  - Weakness quickly gets worse   Progressive difficulty walking:  - Ability to walk may be lost by age 12, and the child will have to use a wheelchair  - Breathing difficulties and heart disease usually start by age 20</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q111-S3-A2" pairid="282">The symptoms usually appear before age 6 and may appear as early as infancy. Typically, the first noticeable symptom is delay of motor milestones, including sitting and standing independently. The mean age for walking in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy is 18 months. There is progressive muscle weakness of the legs and pelvic muscles, which is associated with a loss of muscle mass (wasting). This muscle weakness causes a waddling gait and difficulty climbing stairs. Muscle weakness also occurs in the arms, neck, and other areas, but not as severely or as early as in the lower half of the body.  Calf muscles initially enlarge and the enlarged muscle tissue is eventually replaced with fat and connective tissue (pseudohypertrophy). Muscle contractures occur in the legs, making the muscles unusable because the muscle fibers shorten and fibrosis occurs in connective tissue. Occasionally, there can be pain in the calves.  Symptoms usually appear in boys aged 1 to 6. There is a steady decline in muscle strength between the ages of 6 and 11 years. By age 10, braces may be required for walking, and by age 12, most boys are confined to a wheelchair. Bones develop abnormally, causing skeletal deformities of the spine and other areas.  Muscular weakness and skeletal deformities frequently contribute to breathing disorders. Cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart) occurs in almost all cases, beginning in the early teens in some, and in all after the age of 18 years. Intellectual impairment may occur, but it is not inevitable and does not worsen as the disorder progresses.  Few individuals with DMD live beyond their 30s. Breathing complications and cardiomyopathy are common causes of death.</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q111-S4-A1" pairid="283">There is no known cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Treatment aims to control symptoms to improve quality of life.   Steroid drugs can slow the loss of muscle strength. They may be started when the child is diagnosed or when muscle strength begins to decline.  Other treatments may include:  - Albuterol--a drug used for people with asthma  - Amino acids  - Carnitine  - Coenzyme Q10  - Creatine  - Fish oil  - Green tea extracts  - Vitamin E   However, the effects of these treatments have not been proven. Stem cells and gene therapy may be used in the future.  Activity is encouraged. Inactivity (such as bedrest) can make the muscle disease worse. Physical therapy may help to maintain muscle strength and function. Speech therapy is often needed.  Other treatments may include:  - Assisted ventilation (used during the day or night)  - Drugs to help heart function, such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics  - Orthopedic appliances (such as braces and wheelchairs) to improve mobility  - Proton pump inhibitors (for people with gastroesophageal reflux)   Several new treatments are being studied in trials.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q111-S4-A2" pairid="284">Treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is aimed at the symptoms. Aggressive management of dilated cardiomyopathy with anti-congestive medications is used, including cardiac transplantation in severe cases. Assistive devices for respiratory complications may be needed, especially at night. The medication prednisone - a steroid - is given to improve the strength and function of individuals with DMD. Prednisone has been shown to prolong the ability to walk by 2 to 5 years. However, the possible side effects of prednisone include weight gain, high blood pressure, behavior changes, and delayed growth. A synthetic form of prednisilone, called Deflazacort, is used in Europe and believed to have fewer side effects than prednisone. A medication called cyclosporine has been used and has improved clinical function in children, but its use is controversial due to cyclosporine-induced myopathy. Oxandrolone, a medication used in a research study, has similar effects to prednisone with fewer side effects. Several other therapies are also under investigation, including coenzyme Q10, glutamine, pentoxifylline, and PTC124 (see clinical research below). Physical therapy is used to promote mobility and prevent contractures. Surgery may be needed for severe contractures and scoliosis.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q112-S1-A1" pairid="286">The first treatment for a slipped disk is a short period of rest with medicines for the pain. This is followed by physical therapy. Most people who follow these treatments recover and return to normal activities. Some people will need to have more treatment. This may include steroid injections or surgery.  MEDICINES  Medicines can help with your pain. Your doctor may prescribe any of the following:  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for long-term pain control  - Narcotics if the pain is severe and does not respond to NSAIDs  - Medicines to calm the nerves  - Muscle relaxants to relieve back spasms    LIFESTYLE CHANGES  If you are overweight, diet and exercise are very important for improving back pain.  Physical therapy is important for nearly everyone with disk disease. Therapists will teach you how to properly lift, dress, walk, and perform other activities. They teach you how to strengthen muscles that help support the spine. You will also learn how to increase flexibility in your spine and legs.  Take care of your back at home:   - Reduce activity for the first few days. Slowly restart your usual activities.  - Avoid heavy lifting or twisting your back for the first 6 weeks after the pain starts.  - After 2 to 3 weeks, gradually start exercising again.    INJECTIONS  Steroid medicine injections into the back in the area of the herniated disk may help control pain for several months. These injections reduce swelling around the disk and relieve many symptoms. Spinal injections are usually done in your doctor&apos;s office.   SURGERY  Surgery may be an option if your symptoms do not go away with other treatments and time.  Diskectomy is surgery to remove all or part of a disk.  Discuss with your doctor which treatment options are best for you.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q114-S1-A1" pairid="288">Treatment varies based on:  - Type of tumor  - Whether it is cancer   - Location of the tumor   You may not need treatment if the tumor is:   - Noncancerous (benign)   - In a &quot;safe&quot; area where it will not cause symptoms or problems with the way an organ works    Sometimes benign tumors may be removed for cosmetic reasons. Benign tumors of the brain may be removed because of their location or harmful effect on the surrounding normal brain tissue.  If a tumor is cancer, possible treatments may include:  - Chemotherapy  - Radiation  - Surgery  - Targeted cancer therapy  - Biologic therapy  - Other treatment options</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q114-S1-A2" pairid="289">TA specialized team of doctors advises and assists individuals throughout treatment and rehabilitation.  These doctors may include:  A neurologist is a specialist in nervous system disorders.  An oncologist is a specialist in cancer.  A neuro-oncologist is a neurologist or oncologist who specializes in nervous system tumors.  A neuroradiologist is a doctor trained in reading diagnostic imaging results who specializes in the CNS.  A pathologist is a clinical physician who diagnoses diseases of tissues or cells using a variety of laboratory tests.  A neurosurgeon is a brain or spinal cord surgeon.  A radiation oncologist is a doctor who specializes in using radiation to treat individuals with cancer.  This team will recommend a treatment plan based on the tumor's location, type, size and aggressiveness, as well as on the individual’s medical history, age, and general health.  Initial treatment for a CNS tumor may involve a variety of drugs, including anticonvulsants to treat seizures, pain medications, steroids or other anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce swelling and improve blood flow, antidepressants to treat anxiety or ease depression that might occur following a tumor diagnosis, and drugs to fight nausea caused by various treatments.  Malignant tumors require some form of treatment, while some small benign tumors may need only periodic monitoring.  The three standard treatment options for malignant CNS tumors are neurosurgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.  Some patients may receive a combination of treatments.</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q115-S1-A1" pairid="290">Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. When an asthma attack occurs, the lining of the air passages swells and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway.  In people who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called allergens or triggers.   Common asthma triggers include:  - Animals (pet hair or dander)  - Dust mites  - Certain medicines (aspirin and other NSAIDS)  - Changes in weather (most often cold weather)  - Chemicals in the air or in food  - Exercise  - Mold  - Pollen  - Respiratory infections, such as the common cold  - Strong emotions (stress)  - Tobacco smoke   Substances in some workplaces can also trigger asthma symptoms, leading to occupational asthma. The most common triggers are wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals.  Many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or eczema. Others have no history of allergies.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q115-S1-A2" pairid="291">The exact cause of asthma isn&apos;t known. Researchers think some genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma, most often early in life. These factors include:                  An inherited tendency to develop allergies, called atopy (AT-o-pe)                  Parents who have asthma                  Certain respiratory infections during childhood                  Contact with some airborne allergens or exposure to some viral infections in infancy or in early childhood when the immune system is developing                  If asthma or atopy runs in your family, exposure to irritants (for example, tobacco smoke) may make your airways more reactive to substances in the air.                  Some factors may be more likely to cause asthma in some people than in others. Researchers continue to explore what causes asthma.                  The &quot;Hygiene Hypothesis&quot;                  One theory researchers have for what causes asthma is the &quot;hygiene hypothesis.&quot; They believe that our Western lifestyle—with its emphasis on hygiene and sanitation—has resulted in changes in our living conditions and an overall decline in infections in early childhood.                  Many young children no longer have the same types of environmental exposures and infections as children did in the past. This affects the way that young children&apos;s immune systems develop during very early childhood, and it may increase their risk for atopy and asthma. This is especially true for children who have close family members with one or both of these conditions.</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q116-S1-A1" pairid="294">Most cases of Turner syndrome are not inherited. Most commonly, Turner syndrome occurs due to a random event during the formation of an egg or sperm cell in a parent (prior to conception). For example, if an egg or sperm cell mistakenly loses a sex chromosome, and joins at conception with an egg or sperm containing an X chromosome, the resulting child will have a single X chromosome in each cell. Mosaic Turner syndrome, occurring when a person has some cells with one X chromosome and some cells with two sex chromosomes, is also not inherited. This also occurs due to a random event, during early fetal development rather than before conception. In rare cases, Turner syndrome may be caused by a missing piece (partial deletion) of the X chromosome. A deletion can be inherited from a parent. Genetic testing of an affected fetus or child can identify the type of Turner syndrome present and may help to estimate the risk of recurrence. People with questions about genetic testing or recurrence risks for Turner syndrome are encouraged to speak with a genetic counselor or other genetics professional.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q116-S1-A2" pairid="295">Most cases of Turner syndrome are not inherited. When this condition results from monosomy X, the chromosomal abnormality occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) in the affected person&apos;s parent. An error in cell division called nondisjunction can result in reproductive cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may lose a sex chromosome as a result of nondisjunction. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have a single X chromosome in each cell and will be missing the other sex chromosome.  Mosaic Turner syndrome is also not inherited. In an affected individual, it occurs as a random event during cell division in early fetal development. As a result, some of an affected person&apos;s cells have the usual two sex chromosomes, and other cells have only one copy of the X chromosome. Other sex chromosome abnormalities are also possible in females with X chromosome mosaicism.  Rarely, Turner syndrome caused by a partial deletion of the X chromosome can be passed from one generation to the next.</ANSWER>

Gene Therapy Research for Salivary Gland Dysfunction Scientists at NIH’s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction. The idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with Sjögren&apos;s syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment. The hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions. NIDCR recently completed a clinical study, a research study in humans, on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands. The study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth. Read NIDCR’s news release  to learn more about the study’s findings. Based on the promising results of this trial, similar clinical trials are planned in the near future. Research on Sjögren’s Syndrome and Other Diseases Affecting Salivary Glands NIDCR is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome. Such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow. Other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes, auto inflammatory diseases, and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction. Such studies could one day lead to better ways of preventing and treating salivary gland conditions.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q122-S1-A1" pairid="308">Adrenoleukodystrophy describes several closely related inherited disorders that disrupt the breakdown (metabolism) of certain fats (very long chain fatty acids).</ANSWER>						
				<ANSWER answerid="Q122-S1-A2" pairid="309">X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is one of a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies that cause damage to the myelin sheath, an insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells in the brain. Women have two X chromosomes and are the carriers of the disease, but since men only have one X chromosome and lack the protective effect of the extra X chromosome, they are more severely affected.  People with X-ALD accumulate high levels of saturated, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in the brain and adrenal cortex. The loss of myelin and the progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland are the primary characteristics of X-ALD. While nearly all patients with X-ALD suffer from adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison&apos;s disease, the neurological symptoms can begin either in childhood or in adulthood. The childhood cerebral form is the most severe, with onset between ages 4 and 10. The most common symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance. Other symptoms include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fatigue, intermittent vomiting, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive dementia. The milder adult-onset form is also known as adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), which typically begins between ages 21 and 35.  Symptoms may include progressive stiffness, weakness or paralysis of the lower limbs, and ataxia. Although adult-onset ALD progresses more slowly than the classic childhood form, it can also result in deterioration of brain function. Almost half the women who are carriers of X-ALS will develop a milder form of AMN but almost never will develop symptoms seen in boys the X-ALD.  X-ALD should not be confused with neonatal adrenoleukodsystrophy, which is a disease of newborns and young infants and belongs to the group of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q122-S1-A3" pairid="310">The NINDS supports research on genetic disorders such as ALD. The aim of this research is to find ways to prevent, treat, and cure these disorders. Studies are currently underway to identify new biomarkers of disease progression and to determine which patients will develop the childhood cerebral form of X-ALD.  A recent case study in Europe demonstrated that the combination of gene therapy with bone marrow transplantation, using the patient&apos;s own bone marrow cells, may arrest disease progression in childhood cerebral X-ALD.  A therapeutic trail in the United States is currently being discussed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q123-S1-A1" pairid="313">HIV/AIDS is treated with medicines that stop the virus from multiplying. This treatment is called antiretroviral therapy (ART).  In the past, people with HIV infection would start antiretroviral treatment after their CD4 count dropped or they developed HIV complications. Today, HIV treatment is recommended for all people with HIV infection, even if their CD4 count is still normal.  Regular blood tests are needed to make sure the virus level in the blood (viral load) is kept low, or suppressed. The goal of treatment is to lower the HIV virus in the blood to a level that is so low that the test can&apos;t detect it. This is called an undetectable viral load.  If the CD4 count already dropped before treatment was started, it will usually slowly go up. HIV complications often disappear as the immune system recovers.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q125-S1-A1" pairid="315">Type 2 diabetes may be reversed with lifestyle changes, especially losing weight with exercise and by eating healthier foods. Some cases of type 2 diabetes can also be improved with weight-loss surgery.  There is no cure for type 1 diabetes.   Treating either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes involves medicines, diet, and exercise to control blood sugar level.  Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your provider about seeing a diabetes nurse educator.   Getting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk of kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke.  To prevent diabetes complications, visit your provider at least 2 to 4 times a year. Talk about any problems you are having. Follow your provider&apos;s instructions on managing your diabetes.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q125-S1-A2" pairid="316">The goal of treatment at first is to lower your high blood glucose levels. Long-term goals are to prevent problems from diabetes.  The most important way to treat and manage type 2 diabetes is with activity and healthy eating.  Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your healthcare provider about seeing a diabetes educator.   LEARN THESE SKILLS  Learning diabetes management skills will help you live well with diabetes. These skills help prevent health problems and the need for medical care. Skills include:  - How to test and record your blood glucose  - What and when to eat  - How to safely increase your activity and control your weight  - How to take medications, if needed  - How to recognize and treat low and high blood sugar  - How to handle sick days  - Where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them    It may take several months to learn these skills. Keep learning about diabetes, its complications, and how to control and live well with the disease. Stay up-to-date on new research and treatments.  MANAGING YOUR BLOOD SUGAR  Checking your blood sugar levels yourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.  To check your blood sugar level, you use a device called a glucose meter. Usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet. This gives you a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. The meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.  Your doctor or diabetes educator will help set up a testing schedule for you. Your doctor will help you set a target range for your blood sugar numbers. Keep these factors in mind:  - Most people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day.  - If your blood sugar level is under control, you may only need to check it a few times a week.  - You may test yourself when you wake up, before meals, and at bedtime.  - You may need to test more often when you are sick or under stress.    Keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor. Based on your numbers, you may need to make changes to your meals, activity, or medicines to keep your blood sugar level in the right range.   HEALTHY EATING AND WEIGHT CONTROL  Work closely with your doctor, nurse, and dietitian to learn how much fat, protein, and carbohydrates you need in your diet. Your meal plans should fit your lifestyle and habits and should include foods that you like.  Managing your weight and having a well-balanced diet are important. Some people with type 2 diabetes can stop taking medicines after losing weight. This does not mean that their diabetes is cured. They still have diabetes.  Very obese patients whose diabetes is not well managed with diet and medicine may consider weight loss (bariatric) surgery.  REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY  Regular activity is important for everyone. It is even more important when you have diabetes. Exercise is good for your health because it:  - Lowers your blood sugar level without medicine  - Burns extra calories and fat to help manage your weight  - Improves blood flow and blood pressure  - Increases your energy level  - Improves your ability to handle stress    Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. People with type 2 diabetes may need to take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.   MEDICATIONS TO TREAT DIABETES  If diet and exercise do not help keep your blood sugar at normal or near-normal levels, your doctor may prescribe medication. Since these drugs help lower your blood sugar levels in different ways, your doctor may have you take more than one drug.  Some of the most common types of medication are listed below. They are taken by mouth or injection.  - Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors  - Biguanides  - DPP IV inhibitors  - Injectable medicines (GLP-1 analogs)  - Meglitinides  - SGL T2 inhibitors  - Sulfonylureas  - Thiazolidinediones    You may need to take insulin if your blood sugar cannot be controlled with any of the above medicines. Insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or pump. It cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.  PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS  Your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing some of the more common complications of diabetes, including:   - Eye disease  - Kidney disease  - Heart disease and stroke   FOOT CARE  People with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. Diabetes damages the nerves. This can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot. You many not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection.  Diabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.  To prevent problems with your feet:  - Stop smoking if you smoke.  - Improve control of your blood sugar.  - Get a foot exam by your doctor at least twice a year and learn if you have nerve damage.  - Check and care for your feet every day. This is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems.  - Treat minor infections, such as athlete&apos;s foot, right away.  - Use moisturizing lotion on dry skin.  - Make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. Ask your doctor what type of shoe is right for you.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q125-S1-A3" pairid="317">Diabetes cannot be cured, but it can be managed. Managing blood glucose (blood sugar) as well as blood pressure and cholesterol is the best defense against the serious complications of diabetes. Know What To Do Every Day To manage your diabetes, here are things to do every day.  -  Take your medicines.   -  Keep track of your blood glucose (blood sugar).   -  Check your blood pressure if your doctor advises.   -  Check your feet.   -  Brush your teeth and floss.   -  Stop smoking.   -  Eat well.   -  Be active.  Take your medicines. Keep track of your blood glucose (blood sugar). Check your blood pressure if your doctor advises. Check your feet. Brush your teeth and floss. Stop smoking. Eat well. Be active.

To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) Take Your Diabetes Medicines People with type 1 diabetes control their blood sugar with insulin -- delivered either by injection or with a pump. Many people with type 2 diabetes can control blood glucose levels with diet and exercise alone. Others require oral medications or insulin, and some may need both, as well as lifestyle modification. Ask your doctor if you need to take aspirin every day to prevent a heart attack or stroke. Keep Track of Your Blood Glucose One of the best ways to find out how well you are taking care of your diabetes is to check your blood to see how much glucose is in it. If your blood has too much or too little glucose, you may need a change in your meal plan, exercise plan, or medication. Ask your doctor how often you should check your blood glucose. Some people check their blood glucose once a day. Others do it three a day or even more. You may be told to check before eating, before bed, and sometimes in the middle of the night. Your doctor or diabetes educator will show you how to check your blood using a blood glucose meter. Your health insurance or Medicare may pay for some of the supplies and equipment you need to check your glucose levels.  See what diabetes supplies and services Medicare covers.  Check Your Blood Pressure Check your blood pressure if your doctor advises and keep a record of it. You can check your pressure at home with a home blood pressure measurement device or monitor. Blood pressure monitors can be bought at discount chain stores and drug stores. When you are taking your blood pressure at home, sit with your back supported and your feet flat on the floor. Rest your arm on a table at the level of your heart. Check with your health care provider to make sure you are using the monitor correctly. Check Your Feet Foot care is very important for people with diabetes. High blood glucose levels and a reduced blood supply to the limbs cause nerve damage that reduces feeling in the feet. Someone with nerve damage may not feel a pebble inside his or her sock that is causing a sore. Or a blister caused by poorly fitting shoes may go unnoticed. Foot injuries such as these can cause ulcers, which may, if not cared for, ultimately lead to the need for amputation. If you have diabetes, - check your feet every day and watch for any cuts, sores, red spots, swelling, and infected toenails.   - report sores, blisters, breaks in the skin, infections, or buildup of calluses to a podiatrist or a family doctor.   - never walk barefoot.   - have your feet checked at every doctor visit.   - take your shoes and socks off when you go into the examining room. This will remind the doctor to check your feet.  check your feet every day and watch for any cuts, sores, red spots, swelling, and infected toenails. report sores, blisters, breaks in the skin, infections, or buildup of calluses to a podiatrist or a family doctor. never walk barefoot. have your feet checked at every doctor visit. take your shoes and socks off when you go into the examining room.

Brush Your Teeth and Floss People with diabetes can have tooth and gum problems more often if their blood glucose stays high. High blood glucose also can make tooth and gum problems worse. You can even lose your teeth. Here are ways to protect your teeth and gums. -  Keep your blood glucose as close to normal as possible.   - Use dental floss at least once a day. Flossing helps prevent the buildup of plaque on your teeth. Plaque can harden and grow under your gums and cause problems. Using a sawing motion, gently bring the floss between the teeth, scraping from bottom to top several times.   - Brush your teeth after each meal and snack. Use a soft toothbrush. Turn the bristles against the gum line and brush gently. Use small, circular motions. Brush the front, back, and top of each tooth.  - If you wear false teeth, keep them clean.  - Call your dentist right away if you have problems with your teeth and gums.

Stop Smoking If you smoke, stop. Smoking raises your risk for many diabetes problems, including heart attack and stroke. Ask for help to quit. Call 1-800 QUITNOW (1-800-784-8669). For more information on smoking and older adults, see  Quitting Smoking for Older Adults.  Eat Well People with diabetes don&apos;t need to buy or prepare special foods. The foods that are best for someone with diabetes are excellent choices for everyone: foods that are low in fat, salt, and sugar, and high in fiber, such as beans, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods help you reach and stay at a weight that&apos;s good for your body, keep your blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol in a desirable range, and prevent or delay heart and blood vessel disease. For more on healthy eating, see Small Steps for Eating Healthy Foods. Be Active Try to exercise almost every day for a total of about 30 to 60 minutes. If you haven&apos;t exercised lately, begin slowly. Start with 5 to 10 minutes, and then add more time. Or exercise for 10 minutes, three times a day. (Tip: you don’t need to get your exercise in all at one time.) For more information on exercise and older adults, see Exercise: How to Get Started or visit  Go4Life®, the exercise and physical activity campaign for older adults from the National Institute on Aging. Be sure to check with your doctor before starting an exercise program.

Because people with diabetes may have more injuries and infections, they should protect their skin by keeping it clean and taking care of minor cuts and bruises. Learn How To Cope With Stress Stress can raise your blood glucose (blood sugar). While it is hard to remove stress from your life, you can learn to handle it. Try deep breathing, gardening, taking a walk, meditating, working on your hobby, or listening to your favorite music.</ANSWER>

			</ANNOTATIONS>
			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q129-S1-A1" pairid="328">Treatment depends on the type of stone and the severity of your symptoms.  Kidney stones that are small most often pass through your system on their own.   - Your urine should be strained so the stone can be saved and tested.  - Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water per day to produce a large amount of urine. This will help the stone pass.  - Pain can be very bad. Over-the-counter pain medicines (for example, ibuprofen and naproxen), either alone or along with narcotics, can be very effective.    Some people with severe pain from kidney stones need to stay in the hospital. You may need to get fluids through a vein.  For some types of stones, your provider may prescribe medicine to prevent stones from forming or help break down and remove the material that is causing the stone. These medicines can include:  - Allopurinol (for uric acid stones)  - Antibiotics (for struvite stones)  - Diuretics  - Phosphate solutions  - Sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate  - Water pills (thiazide diuretics)  - Tamsulosin to relax the ureter and help the stone pass    Surgery is often needed if:  - The stone is too large to pass on its own  - The stone is growing  - The stone is blocking urine flow and causing an infection or kidney damage  - The pain cannot be controlled     Today, most treatments are much less invasive than in the past.  - Lithotripsy is used to remove stones slightly smaller than a half an inch that are located in the kidney or ureter. It uses sound or shock waves to break up stones. Then, the stone fragments leave the body in the urine. It is also called extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy or ESWL.  - Procedures performed by passing a special instrument through a small surgical cut in your skin and into your kidney or ureters are used for large stones, or when the kidneys or surrounding areas are incorrectly formed. The stone is removed with a tube (endoscope).  - Ureteroscopy may be used for stones in the lower urinary tract.  - Rarely, open surgery (nephrolithotomy) may be needed if other methods do not work or are not possible.    Talk to your provider about what treatment options may work for you.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q132-S1-A1" pairid="331">Letrozole is used treat early breast cancer in women who have experienced menopause (change of life; end of monthly menstrual periods) and who have had other treatments, such as radiation or surgery to remove the tumor. It is also used to treat early breast cancer in women who have experienced menopause and who have already been treated with a medication called tamoxifen (Nolvadex) for 5 years. Letrozole is also used in women who have experienced menopause as a first treatment of breast cancer that has spread within the breast or to other areas of the body or in women whose breast cancer has worsened while they were taking tamoxifen. Letrozole is in a class of medications called nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of estrogen produced by the body. This can slow or stop the growth of some types of breast cancer cells that need estrogen to grow.</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q133-S1-A1" pairid="332">Ochoa syndrome is a disorder characterized by urinary problems and unusual facial expressions.  The urinary problems associated with Ochoa syndrome typically become apparent in early childhood or adolescence. People with this disorder may have difficulty controlling the flow of urine (incontinence), which can lead to bedwetting. Individuals with Ochoa syndrome may be unable to completely empty the bladder, often resulting in vesicoureteral reflux, a condition in which urine backs up into the ducts that normally carry it from each kidney to the bladder (the ureters). Urine may also accumulate in the kidneys (hydronephrosis). Vesicoureteral reflux and hydronephrosis can lead to frequent infections of the urinary tract and kidney inflammation (pyelonephritis), causing damage that may eventually result in kidney failure.  Individuals with Ochoa syndrome also exhibit a characteristic frown-like facial grimace when they try to smile or laugh, often described as inversion of facial expression. While this feature may appear earlier than the urinary tract symptoms, perhaps as early as an infant begins to smile, it is often not brought to medical attention.  Approximately two-thirds of individuals with Ochoa syndrome also experience problems with bowel function, such as constipation, loss of bowel control, or muscle spasms of the anus.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q142-S1-A1" pairid="347">RA most often requires lifelong treatment, including medicines, physical therapy, exercise, education, and possibly surgery. Early, aggressive treatment for RA can with newer drug categories can be very helpful slowing joint destruction and preventing deformities.  MEDICINES  Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): These are often the drugs that are tried first in people with RA. They are prescribed along with rest, strengthening exercise, and anti-inflammatory drugs.  - Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) is the most commonly used DMARD for rheumatoid arthritis. Leflunomide (Arava) and hydroxychloroquine may also be used.  - Sulfasalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug that is often combined with methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy).  - These drugs may have serious side effects, so you will need frequent blood tests when taking them.    Anti-inflammatory medications: These include aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen.  - Although NSAIDs work well, long-term use can cause stomach problems, including ulcers and bleeding, and possible heart problems.  - Celecoxib (Celebrex) is another anti-inflammatory drug. Drugs in this class (COX-2 inhibitors) may increase heart attack and stroke risk for some people. Talk to your doctor about whether these medicines are right for you.    Antimalarial medications: This group of medicines includes hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). They are most often used along with methotrexate. It may be weeks or months before you see any benefit from these drugs.  Corticosteroids: These medicines work very well to reduce joint swelling and inflammation, but they can have long-term side effects. Therefore, they should be taken only for a short time and in low doses when possible.  Biologic agents: These drugs are designed to affect parts of the immune system that play a role in the disease process of rheumatoid arthritis.  They may be given when other medicines for rheumatoid arthritis have not worked. Sometimes biologic drugs are started sooner, along with other rheumatoid arthritis drugs.  Most of them are given either under the skin (subcutaneously) or into a vein (intravenously). There are different types of biologic agents:  - White blood cell modulators include: abatacept (Orencia) and rituximab (Rituxan)  - Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors include: adalimumab (Humira), etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), golimumab (Simponi), and certolizumab (Cimzia)  - Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors: tocilizumab (Actemra)    Biologic agents can be very helpful in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, people taking these drugs must be watched very closely because of serious risk factors:  - Infections from bacteria, viruses, and fungi  - Leukemia or lymphoma  - Psoriasis  - Allergic reactions    Other drugs:  - Janus kinase inhibitor: Tofacitinib (Xeljanz). This is a medicine taken by mouth that is now approved for treating RA.    SURGERY  Surgery may be needed to correct severely damaged joints. Surgery may include:  - Removal of the joint lining (synovectomy)  - Total joint replacement in extreme cases; may include total knee, hip replacement, ankle replacement, shoulder replacement, and others    PHYSICAL THERAPY  Range-of-motion exercises and exercise programs prescribed by a physical therapist can delay the loss of joint function and help keep muscles strong.  Sometimes, therapists will use special machines to apply deep heat or electrical stimulation to reduce pain and improve joint movement.  Other therapies that may help ease joint pain include:  - Joint protection techniques  - Heat and cold treatments  - Splints or orthotic devices to support and align joints  - Frequent rest periods between activities, as well as 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night    NUTRITION  Some people with RA may have intolerance or allergies to certain foods. A balanced nutritious diet is recommended. It may be helpful to eat foods rich in fish oils (omega-3 fatty acids). Smoking cigarettes should be stopped. Excessive alcohol should also be avoided.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q142-S1-A3" pairid="349">Most Symptoms Are Treatable Doctors use a variety of approaches to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The goals of treatment are to help relieve pain, reduce swelling, slow down or help prevent joint damage, increase the ability to function, and improve the sense of well-being. Current treatment approaches include - lifestyle modification  - medications  - surgery  - routine monitoring and ongoing care.  lifestyle modification medications surgery routine monitoring and ongoing care. Balance Rest and Exercise People with rheumatoid arthritis need a good balance between rest and exercise; they should rest more when the disease is active and exercise more when it is not. Rest helps to reduce active joint inflammation and pain and to fight fatigue. The length of time for rest will vary from person to person, but in general, shorter rest breaks every now and then are more helpful than long times spent in bed. Exercise is important for maintaining healthy and strong muscles, preserving joint mobility, and maintaining flexibility. Exercise can also help people sleep well, reduce pain, maintain a positive attitude, and manage weight. Exercise programs should take into account the person’s physical abilities, limitations, and changing needs. Learn more about the health benefits of exercise for older adults.  More information about exercise and physical activity for older adults can be found at  Go4Life®, the exercise and physical activity campaign from the National Institute on Aging. Reduce Stress People with rheumatoid arthritis face emotional challenges as well as physical ones. The emotions they feel because of the disease—fear, anger, and frustration—combined with any pain and physical limitations can increase their stress level. Finding ways to reduce stress is important. Regular rest periods can help and so can relaxation, distraction, or visualization exercises. Exercise programs, participation in support groups, and good communication with the health care team are other ways to reduce stress. For more information on exercise classes, you may want to contact the Arthritis Foundation at 1-800-283-7800. Learn about relaxation techniques that may relieve tension. Eat a Healthful Diet Special diets, vitamin supplements, and other alternative approaches have been suggested for treating rheumatoid arthritis. Although such approaches may not be harmful, scientific studies have not yet shown any benefits. Special diets, vitamin supplements, and other alternative approaches have been suggested for treating rheumatoid arthritis. Although such approaches may not be harmful, scientific studies have not yet shown any benefits. See  Eating Well as You Get Older  for more about healthy eating. Reduce Stress on Joints Some people find using a splint for a short time around a painful joint reduces pain and swelling by supporting the joint and letting it rest. Splints are used mostly on wrists and hands, but also on ankles and feet. A doctor or a physical or occupational therapist can help a person choose a splint and make sure it fits properly. Other ways to reduce stress on joints include - self-help devices (for example, zipper pullers, long-handled shoe horns)  -  devices to help with getting on and off chairs, toilet seats, and beds  -  changes in the ways that a person carries out daily activities.  self-help devices (for example, zipper pullers, long-handled shoe horns) devices to help with getting on and off chairs, toilet seats, and beds changes in the ways that a person carries out daily activities.

Early treatment with powerful drugs and drug combinations -- including biologic response modifiers and DMARDs -- instead of single drugs may help prevent the disease from progressing and greatly reduce joint damage. Surgery In some cases, a doctor will recommend surgery to restore function or relieve pain in a damaged joint. Surgery may also improve a person&apos;s ability to perform daily activities. Joint replacement and tendon reconstruction are two types of surgery available to patients with severe joint damage. Routine Monitoring and Ongoing Care Regular medical care is important to monitor the course of the disease, determine the effectiveness and any negative effects of medications, and change therapies as needed. Monitoring typically includes regular visits to the doctor. It also may include blood, urine, and other laboratory tests and x rays. Monitor Osteoporosis Risk People with rheumatoid arthritis may want to discuss preventing osteoporosis with their doctors as part of their long-term, ongoing care. Osteoporosis is a condition in which bones become weakened and fragile. Having rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women, particularly if a person takes corticosteroids. Such patients may want to discuss with their doctors the potential benefits of calcium and vitamin D supplements or other treatments for osteoporosis.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q143-S1-A1" pairid="352">Treatment for adenocarcinoma depends on the stage of the tumor.  Surgery may be done if the tumor has not spread or has spread very little. Along with surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy or both may be used before or after surgery. A small number of people can be cured with this treatment approach.  When the tumor has not spread out of the pancreas but cannot be surgically removed, chemotherapy and radiation therapy together may be recommended.   When the tumor has spread (metastasized) to other organs such as the liver, chemotherapy alone is usually used.  With advanced cancer, the goal of treatment is to manage pain and other symptoms. For example, if the tube that carries bile is blocked by the pancreatic tumor, a procedure to place a tiny metal tube (stent) may be done to open the blockage.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q144-S1-A1" pairid="354">Summary       Osteoporosis makes your bones weak and more likely to break. Anyone can develop osteoporosis, but it is common in older women. As many as half of all women and a quarter of men older than 50 will break a bone due to osteoporosis.    Risk factors include        -  Getting older     -  Being small and thin     -  Having a family history of osteoporosis    -  Taking certain medicines    -  Being a white or Asian woman    -  Having osteopenia, which is low bone density       Osteoporosis is a silent disease. You might not know you have it until you break a bone. A bone mineral density test is the best way to check your bone health. To keep bones strong, eat a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, exercise and do not smoke. If needed, medicines can also help.     NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q144-S1-A2" pairid="355">A Bone Disease Osteoporosis is a disease that thins and weakens the bones to the point that they become fragile and break easily. Women and men with osteoporosis most often break bones in the hip, spine, and wrist, but any bone can be affected. You can&apos;t &quot;catch&quot; osteoporosis or give it to someone else. In the United States, more than 53 million people either already have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass, placing them at risk for more serious bone loss and fractures. Although osteoporosis can strike at any age, it is most common among older people, especially older women. How Bone Loss Occurs Bone is living tissue. Throughout our lives, the body breaks down old bone and replaces it with new bone. But as people age, more bone is broken down than is replaced. The inside of a bone normally looks like a honeycomb, but when a person has osteoporosis, the spaces inside this honeycomb become larger, reflecting the loss of bone density and strength. (The word &quot;osteoporosis&quot; means &quot;porous bone.&quot;) The outside of long bones -- called the cortex -- also thins, further weakening the bone. Sometime around the age of 30, bone mass stops increasing, and the goal for bone health is to keep as much bone as possible for as long as you can. In most women, the rate of bone loss increases for several years after menopause, then slows down again, but continues. In men, the bone loss occurs more slowly. But by age 65 or 70, most men and women are losing bone at the same rate. Weak Bones Can Lead to Fractures Osteoporosis is often called &quot;silent&quot; because bone loss occurs without symptoms. People may not know that they have osteoporosis until a sudden strain, bump, or fall causes a bone to break. This can result in a trip to the hospital, surgery, and possibly a long-term disabling condition. Broken bones in your spine are painful and very slow to heal. People with weak bones in their spine gradually lose height and their posture becomes hunched over. Over time a bent spine can make it hard to walk or even sit up. Broken hips are a very serious problem as we age. They greatly increase the risk of death, especially during the year after they break. People who break a hip might not recover for months or even years. Because they often cannot care for themselves, they are more likely to have to live in a nursing home. Prevention and Treatment The good news is that osteoporosis can often be prevented and treated. Healthy lifestyle choices such as proper diet, exercise, and treatment medications can help prevent further bone loss and reduce the risk of fractures.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q144-S1-A3" pairid="356">Scientists are pursuing a wide range of basic and clinical studies on osteoporosis. Significant advances in preventing and treating osteoporosis continue to be made. Such advances are the direct result of research focused on -  determining the causes and consequences of bone loss at the cellular and tissue levels  - assessing risk factors  - developing new strategies to maintain and even enhance bone density and reduce fracture risk  - exploring the roles of such factors as genetics, hormones, calcium, vitamin D, drugs, and exercise on bone mass. determining the causes and consequences of bone loss at the cellular and tissue levels assessing risk factors developing new strategies to maintain and even enhance bone density and reduce fracture risk exploring the roles of such factors as genetics, hormones, calcium, vitamin D, drugs, and exercise on bone mass.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q146-S2-A1" pairid="373">Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is a condition characterized by stiffness and pain in your shoulder joint. Signs and symptoms typically begin gradually, worsen over time and then resolve, usually within one to three years.  Your risk of developing frozen shoulder increases if you're recovering from a medical condition or procedure that prevents you from moving your arm — such as a stroke or a mastectomy.  Treatment for frozen shoulder involves range-of-motion exercises and, sometimes, corticosteroids and numbing medications injected into the joint capsule. In a small percentage of cases, arthroscopic surgery may be indicated to loosen the joint capsule so that it can move more freely.  It's unusual for frozen shoulder to recur in the same shoulder, but some people can develop it in the opposite shoulder.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q147-S1-A1" pairid="376">The health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. Wheezing or other asthma-related sounds may be heard.   Tests that may be ordered include:  - Allergy testing - skin or a blood test to see if a person with asthma is allergic to certain substances  - Arterial blood gas (usually only done with patients who are having a severe asthma attack)   - Chest x-ray  - Lung function tests, including peak flow measurements</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q147-S1-A2" pairid="377">Your primary care doctor will diagnose asthma based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.                  Your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthma—that is, whether it&apos;s intermittent, mild, moderate, or severe. The level of severity will determine what treatment you&apos;ll start on.                  You may need to see an asthma specialist if:                  You need special tests to help diagnose asthma                  You&apos;ve had a life-threatening asthma attack                  You need more than one kind of medicine or higher doses of medicine to control your asthma, or if you have overall problems getting your asthma well controlled                  You&apos;re thinking about getting allergy treatments                  Medical and Family Histories                  Your doctor may ask about your family history of asthma and allergies. He or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur.                  Let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places, or if they get worse at night.                  Your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them. For more information about possible asthma triggers, go to &quot;What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?&quot;                  Your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management. These conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea.                  Physical Exam                  Your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies. These signs include wheezing, a runny nose or swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema).                  Keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don&apos;t have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you.                  Diagnostic Tests                  Lung Function Test                  Your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out.                  Your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved.                  If the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine, and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms, your diagnosis will likely be asthma.                  Other Tests                  Your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis. Other tests may include:                  Allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you, if any.                  A test to measure how sensitive your airways are. This is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-KO-prav-eh-KA-shun) test. Using spirometry, this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in.                  A test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma, such as reflux disease, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea.                  A chest x ray or an EKG (electrocardiogram). These tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms.                  Diagnosing Asthma in Young Children                  Most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age. However, asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose.                  Sometimes it&apos;s hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition. This is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions.                  Also, many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don&apos;t go on to have asthma after they&apos;re 6 years old.                  A child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections. The airways grow as the child grows older, so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds.                  A young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if:                  One or both parents have asthma                  The child has signs of allergies, including the allergic skin condition eczema                  The child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens                  The child wheezes even when he or she doesn&apos;t have a cold or other infection                  The most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test, a medical history, and a physical exam. However, it&apos;s hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years. Thus, doctors must rely on children&apos;s medical histories, signs and symptoms, and physical exams to make a diagnosis.                  Doctors also may use a 4–6 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q148-S1-A1" pairid="378">Blood pressure is a measurement of the force exerted against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood to your body. Hypertension is the term used to describe high blood pressure.  Blood pressure readings are given as two numbers. The top number is called the systolic blood pressure. The bottom number is called the diastolic blood pressure. For example, 120 over 80 (written as 120/80 mmHg).   One or both of these numbers can be too high. (Note: These numbers apply to people who are not taking medicines for blood pressure and are not ill.)  - Normal blood pressure is when your blood pressure is lower than 120/80 mmHg most of the time.  - High blood pressure (hypertension) is when your blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg or above most of the time.  - If your blood pressure numbers are 120/80 or higher, but below 140/90, it is called pre-hypertension.    If you have heart or kidney problems, or you had a stroke, your doctor may want your blood pressure to be even lower than that of people who do not have these conditions.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q148-S1-A2" pairid="379">Summary       Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.     Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. A reading of       - 119/79 or lower is normal blood pressure    - 140/90 or higher is high blood pressure    - Between 120 and 139 for the top number, or between 80 and 89 for the bottom number is called prehypertension. Prehypertension means you may end up with high blood pressure, unless you take steps to prevent it.       High blood pressure usually has no symptoms, but it can cause serious problems such as stroke, heart failure, heart attack and kidney failure.    You can control high blood pressure through healthy lifestyle habits such as exercise and the DASH diet and taking medicines, if needed.     NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</ANSWER>

The pain is most often linked to fatigue, sleep problems, headaches, depression, and anxiety.  People with fibromalgia may also have tenderness in the joints, muscles, tendons, and other soft tissues.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q148-S2-A2" pairid="381">Summary       Fibromyalgia is a disorder that causes muscle pain and fatigue. People with fibromyalgia have &quot;tender points&quot; on the body. Tender points are specific places on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs. These points hurt when pressure is put on them.    People with fibromyalgia may also have other symptoms, such as       - Trouble sleeping    - Morning stiffness    - Headaches    - Painful menstrual periods    - Tingling or numbness in hands and feet    - Problems with thinking and memory (sometimes called &quot;fibro fog&quot;)       No one knows what causes fibromyalgia. Anyone can get it, but it is most common in middle-aged women. People with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases are particularly likely to develop fibromyalgia. There is no cure for fibromyalgia, but medicine can help you manage your symptoms. Getting enough sleep, exercising, and eating well may also help.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q149-S1-A1" pairid="382">The goals of treatment are:  - Control airway swelling  - Stay away from substances that trigger your symptoms   - Help you to be able to do normal activities without asthma symptoms   You and your doctor should work as a team to manage your asthma. Follow your doctor&apos;s instructions on taking medicines, eliminating asthma triggers, and monitoring symptoms.  MEDICINES FOR ASTHMA   There are two kinds of medicines for treating asthma:  - Control medicines to help prevent attacks  - Quick-relief (rescue) medicines for use during attacks   LONG-TERM MEDICINES  These are also called maintenance or control medicines. They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take them every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK.  Some long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your doctor will prescribe the right medicine for you.  QUICK-RELIEF MEDICINES  These are also called rescue medicines. They are taken:  - For coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or an asthma attack  - Just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise   Tell your doctor if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more. If so, your asthma may not be under control and your doctor may need to change your dose of daily control drugs.  Quick-relief medicines include:  - Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators  - Oral corticosteroids for when you have an asthma attack that is not going away   A severe asthma attack requires a checkup by a doctor. You may also need a hospital stay. There, you will likely be given oxygen, breathing assistance, and medicines given through a vein (IV).  ASTHMA CARE AT HOME  - Know the asthma symptoms to watch for.  - Know how to take your peak flow reading and what it means.  - Know which triggers make your asthma worse and what to do when this happens.  - Know how to care for your asthma when you exercise.   Asthma action plans are written documents for managing asthma. An asthma action plan should include:  - Instructions for taking asthma medicines when your condition is stable  - A list of asthma triggers and how to avoid them  - How to recognize when your asthma is getting worse, and when to call your doctor or nurse   A peak flow meter is a simple device to measure how quickly you can move air out of your lungs.  - It can help you see if an attack is coming, sometimes even before symptoms appear. Peak flow measurements help let you know when you need to take medicine or other action.  - Peak flow values of 50 to 80% of your best results are a sign of a moderate asthma attack. Numbers below 50% are a sign of a severe attack.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q149-S1-A2" pairid="383">Asthma is a long-term disease that has no cure. The goal of asthma treatment is to control the disease. Good asthma control will:                  Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath                  Reduce your need for quick-relief medicines (see below)                  Help you maintain good lung function                  Let you maintain your normal activity level and sleep through the night                  Prevent asthma attacks that could result in an emergency room visit or hospital stay                  To control asthma, partner with your doctor to manage your asthma or your child&apos;s asthma. Children aged 10 or older—and younger children who are able—should take an active role in their asthma care.                  Taking an active role to control your asthma involves:                  Working with your doctor to treat other conditions that can interfere with asthma management.                  Avoiding things that worsen your asthma (asthma triggers). However, one trigger you should not avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active.                  Working with your doctor and other health care providers to create and follow an asthma action plan.                  An asthma action plan gives guidance on taking your medicines properly, avoiding asthma triggers (except physical activity), tracking your level of asthma control, responding to worsening symptoms, and seeking emergency care when needed.                  Asthma is treated with two types of medicines: long-term control and quick-relief medicines. Long-term control medicines help reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms. Quick-relief, or &quot;rescue,&quot; medicines relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up.                  Your initial treatment will depend on the severity of your asthma. Followup asthma treatment will depend on how well your asthma action plan is controlling your symptoms and preventing asthma attacks.                  Your level of asthma control can vary over time and with changes in your home, school, or work environments. These changes can alter how often you&apos;re exposed to the factors that can worsen your asthma.                  Your doctor may need to increase your medicine if your asthma doesn&apos;t stay under control. On the other hand, if your asthma is well controlled for several months, your doctor may decrease your medicine. These adjustments to your medicine will help you maintain the best control possible with the least amount of medicine necessary.                  Asthma treatment for certain groups of people—such as children, pregnant women, or those for whom exercise brings on asthma symptoms—will be adjusted to meet their special needs.                  Follow an Asthma Action Plan                  You can work with your doctor to create a personal asthma action plan. The plan will describe your daily treatments, such as which medicines to take and when to take them. The plan also will explain when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room.                  If your child has asthma, all of the people who care for him or her should know about the child&apos;s asthma action plan. This includes babysitters and workers at daycare centers, schools, and camps. These caretakers can help your child follow his or her action plan.                  Go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&apos;s (NHLBI&apos;s) &quot;Asthma Action Plan&quot; for a sample plan.                  Avoid Things That Can Worsen Your Asthma                  Many common things (called asthma triggers) can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Once you know what these things are, you can take steps to control many of them. (For more information about asthma triggers, go to &quot;What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?&quot;)                  For example, exposure to pollens or air pollution might make your asthma worse. If so, try to limit time outdoors when the levels of these substances in the outdoor air are high. If animal fur triggers your asthma symptoms, keep pets with fur out of your home or bedroom.                  One possible asthma trigger you shouldn’t avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active.                  The NHLBI offers many useful tips for controlling asthma triggers. For more information, go to page 2 of NHLBI&apos;s &quot;Asthma Action Plan.&quot;                  If your asthma symptoms are clearly related to allergens, and you can&apos;t avoid exposure to those allergens, your doctor may advise you to get allergy shots.                  You may need to see a specialist if you&apos;re thinking about getting allergy shots. These shots can lessen or prevent your asthma symptoms, but they can&apos;t cure your asthma.                  Several health conditions can make asthma harder to manage. These conditions include runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Your doctor will treat these conditions as well.                  Medicines                  Your doctor will consider many things when deciding which asthma medicines are best for you. He or she will check to see how well a medicine works for you. Then, he or she will adjust the dose or medicine as needed.                  Asthma medicines can be taken in pill form, but most are taken using a device called an inhaler. An inhaler allows the medicine to go directly to your lungs.                  Not all inhalers are used the same way. Ask your doctor or another health care provider to show you the right way to use your inhaler. Review the way you use your inhaler at every medical visit.                  Long-Term Control Medicines                  Most people who have asthma need to take long-term control medicines daily to help prevent symptoms. The most effective long-term medicines reduce airway inflammation, which helps prevent symptoms from starting. These medicines don&apos;t give you quick relief from symptoms.                  Inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred medicine for long-term control of asthma. They&apos;re the most effective option for long-term relief of the inflammation and swelling that makes your airways sensitive to certain inhaled substances.                  Reducing inflammation helps prevent the chain reaction that causes asthma symptoms. Most people who take these medicines daily find they greatly reduce the severity of symptoms and how often they occur.                  Inhaled corticosteroids generally are safe when taken as prescribed. These medicines are different from the illegal anabolic steroids taken by some athletes. Inhaled corticosteroids aren&apos;t habit-forming, even if you take them every day for many years.                  Like many other medicines, though, inhaled corticosteroids can have side effects. Most doctors agree that the benefits of taking inhaled corticosteroids and preventing asthma attacks far outweigh the risk of side effects.                  One common side effect from inhaled corticosteroids is a mouth infection called thrush. You might be able to use a spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler to avoid thrush. These devices attach to your inhaler. They help prevent the medicine from landing in your mouth or on the back of your throat.                  Check with your doctor to see whether a spacer or holding chamber should be used with the inhaler you have. Also, work with your health care team if you have any questions about how to use a spacer or holding chamber. Rinsing your mouth out with water after taking inhaled corticosteroids also can lower your risk for thrush.                  If you have severe asthma, you may have to take corticosteroid pills or liquid for short periods to get your asthma under control.                  If taken for long periods, these medicines raise your risk for cataracts and osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis). A cataract is the clouding of the lens in your eye. Osteoporosis is a disorder that makes your bones weak and more likely to break.                  Your doctor may have you add another long-term asthma control medicine so he or she can lower your dose of corticosteroids. Or, your doctor may suggest you take calcium and vitamin D pills to protect your bones.                  Other long-term control medicines. Other long-term control medicines include:                  Cromolyn. This medicine is taken using a device called a nebulizer. As you breathe in, the nebulizer sends a fine mist of medicine to your lungs. Cromolyn helps prevent airway inflammation.                  Omalizumab (anti-IgE). This medicine is given as a shot (injection) one or two times a month. It helps prevent your body from reacting to asthma triggers, such as pollen and dust mites. Anti-IgE might be used if other asthma medicines have not worked well.                   A rare, but possibly life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis might occur when the Omalizumab injection is given. If you take this medication, work with your doctor to make sure you understand the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and what actions you  should take.                  Inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists. These medicines open the airways. They might be added to inhaled corticosteroids to improve asthma control. Inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists should never be used on their own for long-term asthma control. They must used with inhaled corticosteroids.                  Leukotriene modifiers. These medicines are taken by mouth. They help block the chain reaction that increases inflammation in your airways.                  Theophylline. This medicine is taken by mouth. Theophylline helps open the airways.                  If your doctor prescribes a long-term control medicine, take it every day to control your asthma. Your asthma symptoms will likely return or get worse if you stop taking your medicine.                  Long-term control medicines can have side effects. Talk with your doctor about these side effects and ways to reduce or avoid them.                  With some medicines, like theophylline, your doctor will check the level of medicine in your blood. This helps ensure that you’re getting enough medicine to relieve your asthma symptoms, but not so much that it causes dangerous side effects.                  Quick-Relief Medicines                  All people who have asthma need quick-relief medicines to help relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up. Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists are the first choice for quick relief.                  These medicines act quickly to relax tight muscles around your airways when you&apos;re having a flareup. This allows the airways to open up so air can flow through them.                  You should take your quick-relief medicine when you first notice asthma symptoms. If you use this medicine more than 2 days a week, talk with your doctor about your asthma control. You may need to make changes to your asthma action plan.                  Carry your quick-relief inhaler with you at all times in case you need it. If your child has asthma, make sure that anyone caring for him or her has the child&apos;s quick-relief medicines, including staff at the child&apos;s school. They should understand when and how to use these medicines and when to seek medical care for your child.                  You shouldn&apos;t use quick-relief medicines in place of prescribed long-term control medicines. Quick-relief medicines don&apos;t reduce inflammation.                  Track Your Asthma                  To track your asthma, keep records of your symptoms, check your peak flow number using a peak flow meter, and get regular asthma checkups.                  Record Your Symptoms                  You can record your asthma symptoms in a diary to see how well your treatments are controlling your asthma.                  Asthma is well controlled if:                  You have symptoms no more than 2 days a week, and these symptoms don&apos;t wake you from sleep more than 1 or 2 nights a month.                  You can do all your normal activities.                  You take quick-relief medicines no more than 2 days a week.                  You have no more than one asthma attack a year that requires you to take corticosteroids by mouth.                  Your peak flow doesn&apos;t drop below 80 percent of your personal best number.                  If your asthma isn&apos;t well controlled, contact your doctor. He or she may need to change your asthma action plan.                  Use a Peak Flow Meter                  This small, hand-held device shows how well air moves out of your lungs. You blow into the device and it gives you a score, or peak flow number. Your score shows how well your lungs are working at the time of the test.                  Your doctor will tell you how and when to use your peak flow meter. He or she also will teach you how to take your medicines based on your score.                  Your doctor and other health care providers may ask you to use your peak flow meter each morning and keep a record of your results. You may find it very useful to record peak flow scores for a couple of weeks before each medical visit and take the results with you.                  When you&apos;re first diagnosed with asthma, it&apos;s important to find your &quot;personal best&quot; peak flow number. To do this, you record your score each day for a 2- to 3-week period when your asthma is well-controlled. The highest number you get during that time is your personal best. You can compare this number to future numbers to make sure your asthma is controlled.                  Your peak flow meter can help warn you of an asthma attack, even before you notice symptoms. If your score shows that your breathing is getting worse, you should take your quick-relief medicines the way your asthma action plan directs. Then you can use the peak flow meter to check how well the medicine worked.                  Get Asthma Checkups                  When you first begin treatment, you&apos;ll see your doctor about every 2 to 6 weeks. Once your asthma is controlled, your doctor may want to see you from once a month to twice a year.                  During these checkups, your doctor may ask whether you&apos;ve had an asthma attack since the last visit or any changes in symptoms or peak flow measurements. He or she also may ask about your daily activities. This information will help your doctor assess your level of asthma control.                  Your doctor also may ask whether you have any problems or concerns with taking your medicines or following your asthma action plan. Based on your answers to these questions, your doctor may change the dose of your medicine or give you a new medicine.                  If your control is very good, you might be able to take less medicine. The goal is to use the least amount of medicine needed to control your asthma.                  Emergency Care                  Most people who have asthma, including many children, can safely manage their symptoms by following their asthma action plans. However, you might need medical attention at times.                  Call your doctor for advice if:                  Your medicines don&apos;t relieve an asthma attack.                  Your peak flow is less than half of your personal best peak flow number.                  Call 9–1–1 for emergency care if:                  You have trouble walking and talking because you&apos;re out of breath.                  You have blue lips or fingernails.                  At the hospital, you&apos;ll be closely watched and given oxygen and more medicines, as well as medicines at higher doses than you take at home. Such treatment can save your life.                  Asthma Treatment for Special Groups                  The treatments described above generally apply to all people who have asthma. However, some aspects of treatment differ for people in certain age groups and those who have special needs.                  Children                  It&apos;s hard to diagnose asthma in children younger than 5 years. Thus, it&apos;s hard to know whether young children who wheeze or have other asthma symptoms will benefit from long-term control medicines. (Quick-relief medicines tend to relieve wheezing in young children whether they have asthma or not.)                  Doctors will treat infants and young children who have asthma symptoms with long-term control medicines if, after assessing a child, they feel that the symptoms are persistent and likely to continue after 6 years of age. (For more information, go to &quot;How Is Asthma Diagnosed?&quot;)                  Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for young children. Montelukast and cromolyn are other options. Treatment might be given for a trial period of 1 month to 6 weeks. Treatment usually is stopped if benefits aren&apos;t seen during that time and the doctor and parents are confident the medicine was used properly.                  Inhaled corticosteroids can possibly slow the growth of children of all ages. Slowed growth usually is apparent in the first several months of treatment, is generally small, and doesn&apos;t get worse over time. Poorly controlled asthma also may reduce a child&apos;s growth rate.                  Many experts think the benefits of inhaled corticosteroids for children who need them to control their asthma far outweigh the risk of slowed growth.                  Older Adults                  Doctors may need to adjust asthma treatment for older adults who take certain other medicines, such as beta blockers, aspirin and other pain relievers, and anti-inflammatory medicines. These medicines can prevent asthma medicines from working well and may worsen asthma symptoms.                  Be sure to tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines.                  Older adults may develop weak bones from using inhaled corticosteroids, especially at high doses. Talk with your doctor about taking calcium and vitamin D pills, as well as other ways to help keep your bones strong.                  Pregnant Women                  Pregnant women who have asthma need to control the disease to ensure a good supply of oxygen to their babies. Poor asthma control increases the risk of preeclampsia, a condition in which a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Poor asthma control also increases the risk that a baby will be born early and have a low birth weight.                  Studies show that it&apos;s safer to take asthma medicines while pregnant than to risk having an asthma attack.                  Talk with your doctor if you have asthma and are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Your level of asthma control may get better or it may get worse while you&apos;re pregnant. Your health care team will check your asthma control often and adjust your treatment as needed.                  People Whose Asthma Symptoms Occur With Physical Activity                  Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Adults need physical activity to maintain good health. Children need it for growth and development.                  In some people, however, physical activity can trigger asthma symptoms. If this happens to you or your child, talk with your doctor about the best ways to control asthma so you can stay active.                  The following medicines may help prevent asthma symptoms caused by physical activity:                  Short-acting beta2-agonists (quick-relief medicine) taken shortly before physical activity can last 2 to 3 hours and prevent exercise-related symptoms in most people who take them.                  Long-acting beta2-agonists can be protective for up to 12 hours. However, with daily use, they&apos;ll no longer give up to 12 hours of protection. Also, frequent use of these medicines for physical activity might be a sign that asthma is poorly controlled.                  Leukotriene modifiers. These pills are taken several hours before physical activity. They can help relieve asthma symptoms brought on by physical activity.                  Long-term control medicines. Frequent or severe symptoms due to physical activity may suggest poorly controlled asthma and the need to either start or increase long-term control medicines that reduce inflammation. This will help prevent exercise-related symptoms.                  Easing into physical activity with a warmup period may be helpful. You also may want to wear a mask or scarf over your mouth when exercising in cold weather.                  If you use your asthma medicines as your doctor directs, you should be able to take part in any physical activity or sport you choose.                  People Having Surgery                  Asthma may add to the risk of having problems during and after surgery. For instance, having a tube put into your throat may cause an asthma attack.                  Tell your surgeon about your asthma when you first talk with him or her. The surgeon can take steps to lower your risk, such as giving you asthma medicines before or during surgery.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q150-S1-A1" pairid="390">The goal of treatment is to reduce your blood pressure so that you have a lower risk of complications. You and your provider should set a blood pressure goal for you.  If you have pre-hypertension, your provider will recommend lifestyle changes to bring your blood pressure down to a normal range. Medicines are rarely used for pre-hypertension.  LIFESTYLE CHANGES  You can do many things to help control your blood pressure at home, including:  - Eat a heart-healthy diet, including potassium and fiber.  - Drink plenty of water.  - Exercise regularly for at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a day.  - If you smoke, quit.  - Limit how much alcohol you drink to 1 drink a day for women, and 2 a day for men.  - Limit the amount of sodium (salt) you eat. Aim for less than 1,500 mg per day.  - Reduce stress. Try to avoid things that cause you stress, and try meditation or yoga to de-stress.  - Stay at a healthy body weight.     Your provider can help you find programs for losing weight, stopping smoking, and exercising.  You can also get a referral to a dietitian, who can help you plan a diet that is healthy for you.  How low your blood pressure should be and at what level you need to start treatment is individualized, based on your age and any medical problems you have.  MEDICINES FOR HYPERTENSION  Most of the time, your provider will try lifestyle changes first and check your BP 2 or more times. Medicines will likely be started if your BP readings remain at or above these levels:  - Top number (systolic pressure) of 140 or more in people younger than 60 years  - Top number of 150 or more in people 60 years and older  - Bottom number (diastolic pressure) of 90 or more    If you have diabetes, heart problems, or a history of a stroke, medicines may be started at lower blood pressure reading. The most commonly used blood pressure targets for people with these medical problems are below 130 to 140/80 mmHg.  There are many different medicines to treat high blood pressure.  - Often, a single blood pressure drug may not be enough to control your blood pressure, and you may need to take two or more drugs.  - It is very important that you take the medicines prescribed to you.  - If you have side effects, your doctor can substitute a different medicine.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q151-S1-A1" pairid="391">Treatment for Dry Mouth  Dry mouth treatment will depend on what is causing the problem. If you think you have dry mouth, see your dentist or physician. He or she can help to determine what is causing your dry mouth. If your dry mouth is caused by medicine, your physician might change your medicine or adjust the dosage. If your salivary glands are not working right but can still produce some saliva, your dentist or physician might give you a medicine that helps the glands work better. Your dentist or physician might also suggest that you use artificial saliva to keep your mouth wet. Do&apos;s and Don&apos;ts Do&apos;s - Do drink water or sugarless drinks often. That will make chewing and swallowing easier when eating.  - Do chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy to stimulate saliva flow.  - Do use a humidifier at night to promote moisture in the air while you sleep.

Gene Therapy Research for Salivary Gland Dysfunction Scientists at NIH’s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction. The idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with Sjögren&apos;s syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment. The hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions. NIDCR recently completed a clinical study, a research study in humans, on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands. The study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth. Read NIDCR’s news release  to learn more about the study’s findings. Based on the promising results of this trial, similar clinical trials are planned in the near future. Research on Sjögren’s Syndrome and Other Diseases Affecting Salivary Glands NIDCR is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome. Such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow. Other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes, auto inflammatory diseases, and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction. Such studies could one day lead to better ways of preventing and treating salivary gland conditions. To stay abreast of any new studies on gene therapy and salivary gland function, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  ClinicalTrials.gov lists all federally and many privately funded clinical trials in the U.S. and around the world; the web site is updated frequently.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q153-S1-A1" pairid="396">CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE   An active lifestyle and plenty of exercise, along with healthy eating, is the safest way to lose weight. Even modest weight loss can improve your health. You may need a lot of support from family and friends.  Your main goal should be to learn new, healthy ways of eating and make them part of your daily routine.  Many people find it hard to change their eating habits and behaviors. You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle.  Work with your health care provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep them off. Your dietitian can teach you about:  - Healthy food choices  - Healthy snacks  - Reading nutrition labels  - New ways to prepare food  - Portion sizes  - Sweetened drinks    Extreme diets (fewer than 1,100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often do not contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again.  Learn ways to manage stress other than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your provider.    MEDICINES AND HERBAL REMEDIES   You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects. Talk to your provider before using them.  You can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor. Many people lose at least 5 pounds by taking these drugs, but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes.   SURGERY   Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain diseases in people with severe obesity. These risks include:  - Arthritis  - Diabetes  - Heart disease  - High blood pressure  - Sleep apnea  - Some cancers  - Stroke    Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine.  Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you.  Weight-loss surgeries include:  - Laparoscopic gastric banding  - Gastric bypass surgery  - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common)  - Duodenal switch</ANSWER>

TALK THERAPY  During talk therapy, you talk with a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or therapist, in a calm and accepting setting. They can help you manage your PTSD symptoms. They will also guide you as you work through your feelings about the trauma.  There are many types of talk therapy. One type that is often used for PTSD is called desensitization. During therapy, you are encouraged to remember the traumatic event and express your feelings about it. Over time, memories of the event become less frightening.  During talk therapy, you may also learn ways to relax, especially when you start to have flashbacks.  MEDICINES  Your provider may suggest that you take medicines. They can help ease your depression or anxiety. They can also help you sleep better. Medicines need time to work. Do not stop taking them or change the amount (dosage) you take without talking to your provider. Ask your provider about possible side effects and what to do if you experience them.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q155-S1-A1" pairid="399">Treatment of breast papillomas often entails surgical duct excision for symptomatic relief and histopathological examination. Recently, more conservative approach has been adapted. MD-assisted microdochectomy should be considered the procedure of choice for a papilloma-related single duct discharge. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that MD has the potential to reduce the number of duct excision procedures and minimise the extent of surgical resection. Imaging-guided vacuum-assisted core biopsy can be diagnostic and therapeutic for papillomas seen on mammography and/or ultrasound. Patients with multiple papillomas do have an increased risk of developing cancer and should be kept under annual review with regular mammography (preferably digital mammography) if treated conservatively. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be also used in surveillance in view of its high sensitivity. Because the risk is small, long term and affects both breasts, long-term follow-up is more appropriate than prophylactic mastectomy. Patients who prove to have solitary duct papilloma have insufficient increase in the risk of subsequent malignancy to justify routine follow-up. </ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q156-S1-A1" pairid="400">Obesity means having too much body fat. It is not the same as being overweight, which means weighing too much. A person may be overweight from extra muscle or water, as well as from having too much fat.  Both terms mean that a person&apos;s weight is higher than what is thought to be healthy for his or her height.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q156-S1-A2" pairid="401">Summary       Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight, which means weighing too much. The weight may come from muscle, bone, fat, and/or body water. Both terms mean that a person&apos;s weight is greater than what&apos;s considered healthy for his or her height.     Obesity occurs over time when you eat more calories than you use. The balance between calories-in and calories-out differs for each person. Factors that might affect your weight include your genetic makeup, overeating, eating high-fat foods, and not being physically active.     Being obese increases your risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and some cancers. If you are obese, losing even 5 to 10 percent of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example, that means losing 10 to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q156-S2-A1" pairid="402">CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE   An active lifestyle and plenty of exercise, along with healthy eating, is the safest way to lose weight. Even modest weight loss can improve your health. You may need a lot of support from family and friends.  Your main goal should be to learn new, healthy ways of eating and make them part of your daily routine.  Many people find it hard to change their eating habits and behaviors. You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle.  Work with your health care provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep them off. Your dietitian can teach you about:  - Healthy food choices  - Healthy snacks  - Reading nutrition labels  - New ways to prepare food  - Portion sizes  - Sweetened drinks    Extreme diets (fewer than 1,100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often do not contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again.  Learn ways to manage stress other than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your provider.    MEDICINES AND HERBAL REMEDIES   You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects. Talk to your provider before using them.  You can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor. Many people lose at least 5 pounds by taking these drugs, but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes.   SURGERY   Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain diseases in people with severe obesity. These risks include:  - Arthritis  - Diabetes  - Heart disease  - High blood pressure  - Sleep apnea  - Some cancers  - Stroke    Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine.  Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you.  Weight-loss surgeries include:  - Laparoscopic gastric banding  - Gastric bypass surgery  - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common)  - Duodenal switch</ANSWER>

To use this medicine:  - Thoroughly work the medicine into your pubic hair and surrounding area. Leave it on for at least 5 to 10 minutes, or as directed by your health care provider.  - Rinse well.  - Comb your pubic hair with a fine-toothed comb to remove eggs (nits). Applying vinegar to pubic hair before combing may help loosen the nits.    Most people need only 1 treatment. If a second treatment is needed, it should be done 4 days to 1 week later.  Over-the-counter medicines to treat lice include Rid and Nix. Malathione lotion is another option.  OTHER CARE  While you are treating pubic lice:  - Wash all clothing and bedding in hot water.  - Spray items that cannot be washed with a medicated spray that you can buy at the store. You can also seal items in plastic bags for 10 to 14 days to smother the lice.  - Makes sure anyone with whom you have had sexual contact or shared a bed is treated at the same time.    People with pubic lice should be checked for other sexually-transmitted infections when lice are discovered.</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q159-S1-A1" pairid="407">Taking in more calories than your body burns can lead to obesity. This is because the body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by:  - Eating more food than your body can use  - Drinking too much alcohol  - Not getting enough exercise    Many obese people who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost.  Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods become obese, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work normally.   The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults.   The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat.   We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active.   - Many people feel they do not have time to plan and make healthy meals.  - More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past.  - People with little free time may have less time to exercise.    The term eating disorder means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may be obese, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time.  Sometimes, medical problems or treatments cause weight gain, including:  - Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)  - Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics    Other things that can cause weight gain are:  - Quitting smoking. Many people who quit smoking gain 4 to 10 pounds in the first 6 months after quitting.  - Stress, anxiety, feeling sad, or not sleeping well  - Menopause. Women may gain 12 to 15 pounds during menopause.  - Pregnancy. Women may not lose the weight they gained during pregnancy.</ANSWER>

Individuals with Lynch syndrome have a higher risk of developing colon and rectal cancer, as well as cancers of the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder ducts, upper urinary tract, brain, skin, and prostate. Women with Lynch syndrome also have a high risk of developing uterine cancer (also called endometrial cancer) and ovarian cancer. Even though the disorder was originally described as not involving noncancerous (benign) growths (polyps) in the colon, people with Lynch syndrome may occasionally have colon polyps. Lynch syndrome has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and is caused by a mutation in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or EPCAM gene.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q161-S1-A1" pairid="419">Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve. This nerve sends the images you see to your brain.  Most often, optic nerve damage is caused by increased pressure in the eye. This is called intraocular pressure.       Watch this video about:   Glaucoma</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q161-S1-A2" pairid="420">Summary       Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye&apos;s optic nerve. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. It usually happens when the fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises, damaging the optic nerve. Often there are no symptoms at first. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains.    A comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma. People at risk should get eye exams at least every two years. They include       -  African Americans over age 40    -  People over age 60, especially Mexican Americans    -  People with a family history of glaucoma       There is no cure, but glaucoma can usually be controlled. Early treatment can help protect your eyes against vision loss. Treatments usually include prescription eyedrops and/or surgery.    NIH: National Eye Institute</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q161-S1-A3" pairid="421">Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye&apos;s optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. While glaucoma can strike anyone, the risk is much greater for people over 60. How Glaucoma Develops  There are several different types of glaucoma. Most of these involve the drainage system within the eye. At the front of the eye there is a small space called the anterior chamber. A clear fluid flows through this chamber and bathes and nourishes the nearby tissues. (Watch the video to learn more about glaucoma. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) In glaucoma, for still unknown reasons, the fluid drains too slowly out of the eye. As the fluid builds up, the pressure inside the eye rises. Unless this pressure is controlled, it may cause damage to the optic nerve and other parts of the eye and result in loss of vision. Open-angle Glaucoma The most common type of glaucoma is called open-angle glaucoma. In the normal eye, the clear fluid leaves the anterior chamber at the open angle where the cornea and iris meet. When fluid reaches the angle, it flows through a spongy meshwork, like a drain, and leaves the eye. Sometimes, when the fluid reaches the angle, it passes too slowly through the meshwork drain, causing the pressure inside the eye to build. If the pressure damages the optic nerve, open-angle glaucoma -- and vision loss -- may result. There is no cure for glaucoma. Vision lost from the disease cannot be restored. However, there are treatments that may save remaining vision. That is why early diagnosis is important.  See this graphic for a quick overview of glaucoma,  including how many people it affects, who’s at risk, what to do if you have it, and how to learn more.  See a glossary of glaucoma terms.</ANSWER>

Bilirubin travels through your bloodstream to the liver, where normally an enzyme breaks down the bilirubin and removes it from the bloodstream.  The bilirubin passes from the liver into the intestines with bile. It's then excreted in stool. A small amount of bilirubin remains in the blood. How the abnormal gene is passed through families  The abnormal gene that causes Gilbert's syndrome is common. Many people carry one copy of this gene.

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q166-S1-A1" pairid="443">Treatment is based on many factors, including:  - Type and stage of the cancer  - Whether the cancer is sensitive to certain hormones  - Whether the cancer overproduces (overexpresses) the HER2/neu gene    Cancer treatments may include:  - Chemotherapy, which uses medicines to kill cancer cells.  - Radiation therapy, which is used to destroy cancerous tissue.  - Surgery to remove cancerous tissue: A lumpectomy removes the breast lump; mastectomy removes all or part of the breast and possibly nearby structures.  - Targeted therapy uses medicine to attack the gene changes in cancer cells. Hormone therapy is an example of targeted therapy. It blocks certain hormones that fuel cancer growth.     Cancer treatment can be local or systemic:  - Local treatments involve only the area of disease. Radiation and surgery are forms of local treatment. They are most effective when the cancer has not spread outside the breast.  - Systemic treatments affect the entire body. Chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are types of systemic treatment.    Most women receive a combination of treatments. For women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to treat the cancer and prevent it from returning (curing). For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer. In most cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured.  - Stage 0 and ductal carcinoma -- Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy is the standard treatment.  - Stage I and II -- Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy with lymph node removal is the standard treatment. Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and other targeted therapy may also be used after surgery.  - Stage III -- Treatment involves surgery, possibly followed by chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and other targeted therapy.  - Stage IV -- Treatment may involve surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, other targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments.    After treatment, some women continue to take medicines for a time. All women continue to have blood tests, mammograms, and other tests after treatment.  Women who have had a mastectomy may have reconstructive breast surgery. This will be done either at the time of mastectomy or later.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q166-S1-A3" pairid="445">There are many treatment options for women with breast cancer. The choice of treatment depends on your age and general health, the stage of the cancer, whether or not it has spread beyond the breast, and other factors. If tests show that you have cancer, you should talk with your doctor and make treatment decisions as soon as possible. Studies show that early treatment leads to better outcomes. Working With a Team of Specialists People with cancer often are treated by a team of specialists. The team will keep the primary doctor informed about the patient&apos;s progress. The team may include a medical oncologist who is a specialist in cancer treatment, a surgeon, a radiation oncologist who is a specialist in radiation therapy, and others. Before starting treatment, you may want another doctor to review the diagnosis and treatment plan. Some insurance companies require a second opinion. Others may pay for a second opinion if you request it. (Watch the video about this breast cancer survivor&apos;s treatment. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) Clinical Trials for Breast Cancer Some breast cancer patients take part in studies of new treatments. These studies, called clinical trials, are designed to find out whether a new treatment is both safe and effective. Often, clinical trials compare a new treatment with a standard one so that doctors can learn which is more effective. Women with breast cancer who are interested in taking part in a clinical trial should talk to their doctor. The U.S. National Institutes of Health, through its National Library of Medicine and other Institutes, maintains a database of clinical trials at ClinicalTrials.gov. See a list of the current clinical trials on breast cancer.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q166-S1-A4" pairid="446">There are a number of treatments for breast cancer, but the ones women choose most often -- alone or in combination -- are surgery, hormone therapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. What Standard Treatments Do Here is what the standard cancer treatments are designed to do. - Surgery takes out the cancer and some surrounding tissue.   - Hormone therapy keeps cancer cells from getting most of the hormones they need to survive and grow.  - Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors and some surrounding tissue.  -  Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer drugs to kill most cancer cells. Surgery takes out the cancer and some surrounding tissue. Hormone therapy keeps cancer cells from getting most of the hormones they need to survive and grow. Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors and some surrounding tissue.  Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer drugs to kill most cancer cells. Treatment for breast cancer may involve local or whole body therapy. Doctors use local therapies, such as surgery or radiation, to remove or destroy breast cancer in a specific area. Whole body, or systemic, treatments like chemotherapy, hormonal, or biological therapies are used to destroy or control cancer throughout the body. Some patients have both kinds of treatment. Treating Early-Stage Breast Cancer If you have early-stage breast cancer, one common treatment available to you is a lumpectomy combined with radiation therapy. A lumpectomy is surgery that preserves a woman&apos;s breast. In a lumpectomy, the surgeon removes only the tumor and a small amount of the surrounding tissue. The survival rate for a woman who has this therapy plus radiation is similar to that for a woman who chooses a radical mastectomy, which is complete removal of a breast. If Cancer Has Spread Locally If you have breast cancer that has spread locally -- just to other parts of the breast -- your treatment may involve a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Doctors usually first shrink the tumor with chemotherapy and then remove it through surgery. Shrinking the tumor before surgery may allow a woman to avoid a mastectomy and keep her breast. In the past, doctors would remove a lot of lymph nodes near breast tumors to see if the cancer had spread. Some doctors also use a method called sentinel node biopsy. Using a dye or radioactive tracer, surgeons locate the first or sentinel lymph node closest to the tumor, and remove only that node to see if the cancer has spread. If Cancer Has Spread Beyond the Breast If the breast cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lung or bone, you might receive chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy to destroy cancer cells and control the disease. Radiation therapy may also be useful to control tumors in other parts of the body. Get more information about treatment options for breast cancer  and for  recurrent breast cancer.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q166-S1-A5" pairid="449">Standard treatments for breast cancer include - surgery that takes out the cancer and some surrounding tissue  - radiation therapy that uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors and some surrounding tissue.  - chemotherapy that uses anti-cancer drugs to kill cancer most cells  - hormone therapy that keeps cancer cells from getting most of the hormones they need to survive and grow. surgery that takes out the cancer and some surrounding tissue radiation therapy that uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors and some surrounding tissue. chemotherapy that uses anti-cancer drugs to kill cancer most cells hormone therapy that keeps cancer cells from getting most of the hormones they need to survive and grow.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q166-S1-A6" pairid="450">Even if the surgeon removes all of the cancer that can be seen at the time of surgery, a woman may still receive follow-up treatment. This may include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy to try to kill any cancer cells that may be left. Treatment that a patient receives after surgery to increase the chances of a cure is called adjuvant therapy.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q166-S1-A7" pairid="451">Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. This therapy often follows a lumpectomy, and is sometimes used after mastectomy. During radiation therapy, a machine outside the body sends high-energy beams to kill the cancer cells that may still be present in the affected breast or in nearby lymph nodes. Doctors sometimes use radiation therapy along with chemotherapy, or before or instead of surgery.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q166-S1-A8" pairid="452">Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. A patient may take chemotherapy by mouth in pill form, or it may be put into the body by inserting a needle into a vein or muscle. Chemotherapy is called whole body or systemic treatment if the drug(s) enter the bloodstream, travel through the body, and kill cancer cells throughout the body. Treatment with standard chemotherapy can be as short as two months or as long as two years. Targeted therapies, usually in pill form, have become more common and focus on either a gene or protein abnormality and usually have few adverse side-effects as they directly affect the abnormality and not other cells or tissues in the body. Sometimes chemotherapy is the only treatment the doctor will recommend. More often, however, chemotherapy is used in addition to surgery, radiation therapy, and/or biological therapy.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q166-S1-A9" pairid="453">Hormonal therapy keeps cancer cells from getting the hormones they need to grow. This treatment may include the use of drugs that change the way hormones work. Sometimes it includes surgery to remove the ovaries, which make female hormones. Like chemotherapy, hormonal therapy can affect cancer cells throughout the body. Often, women with early-stage breast cancer and those with metastatic breast cancer -- meaning cancer that has spread to other parts of the body -- receive hormone therapy in the form of tamoxifen. Hormone therapy with tamoxifen or estrogens can act on cells all over the body. However, it may increase the chance of developing endometrial cancer. If you take tamoxifen, you should have a pelvic examination every year to look for any signs of cancer. A woman should report any vaginal bleeding, other than menstrual bleeding, to her doctor as soon as possible.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q166-S1-A10" pairid="454">Certain drugs that have been used successfully in other cancers are now being used to treat some breast cancers. A mix of drugs may increase the length of time you will live, or the length of time you will live without cancer. In addition, certain drugs like Herceptin® and Tykerb® taken in combination with chemotherapy, can help women with specific genetic breast cancer mutations better than chemotherapy alone.</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>				
				<ANSWER answerid="Q167-S1-A1" pairid="455">Polymicrogyria is a condition characterized by abnormal development of the brain before birth. The surface of the brain normally has many ridges or folds, called gyri. In people with polymicrogyria, the brain develops too many folds, and the folds are unusually small. The name of this condition literally means too many (poly-) small (micro-) folds (-gyria) in the surface of the brain.  Polymicrogyria can affect part of the brain or the whole brain. When the condition affects one side of the brain, researchers describe it as unilateral. When it affects both sides of the brain, it is described as bilateral. The signs and symptoms associated with polymicrogyria depend on how much of the brain, and which particular brain regions, are affected.  Researchers have identified multiple forms of polymicrogyria. The mildest form is known as unilateral focal polymicrogyria. This form of the condition affects a relatively small area on one side of the brain. It may cause minor neurological problems, such as mild seizures that can be easily controlled with medication. Some people with unilateral focal polymicrogyria do not have any problems associated with the condition.  Bilateral forms of polymicrogyria tend to cause more severe neurological problems. Signs and symptoms of these conditions can include recurrent seizures (epilepsy), delayed development, crossed eyes, problems with speech and swallowing, and muscle weakness or paralysis. The most severe form of the disorder, bilateral generalized polymicrogyria, affects the entire brain. This condition causes severe intellectual disability, problems with movement, and seizures that are difficult or impossible to control with medication.  Polymicrogyria most often occurs as an isolated feature, although it can occur with other brain abnormalities. It is also a feature of several genetic syndromes characterized by intellectual disability and multiple birth defects. These include 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Adams-Oliver syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Galloway-Mowat syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and Zellweger spectrum disorder.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q168-S1-A2" pairid="458">Summary       Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden, unexplained death of an infant younger than one year old. Some people call SIDS &quot;crib death&quot; because many babies who die of SIDS are found in their cribs.     SIDS is the leading cause of death in children between one month and one year old. Most SIDS deaths occur when babies are between two months and four months old. Premature babies, boys, African Americans, and American Indian/Alaska Native infants have a higher risk of SIDS.    Although health care professionals don&apos;t know what causes SIDS, they do know ways to reduce the risk. These include       - Placing babies on their backs to sleep, even for short naps. &quot;Tummy time&quot; is for when babies are awake and someone is watching    - Using a firm sleep surface, such as a crib mattress covered with a fitted sheet     - Keeping soft objects and loose bedding away from sleep area    - Making sure babies don&apos;t get too hot. Keep the room at a comfortable temperature for an adult.    - Don&apos;t smoke during pregnancy or allow anyone to smoke near your baby       NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q171-S1-A1" pairid="462">There are two major types of stroke:   - Ischemic stroke  - Hemorrhagic stroke    Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This may happen in two ways:   - A clot may form in an artery that is already very narrow. This is called a thrombotic stroke.  - A clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain. This is called cerebral embolism, or an embolic stroke.    Ischemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries.       Watch this video about:   Stroke         Watch this video about:   Stroke - secondary to cardiogenic embolism     A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. This causes blood to leak into the brain. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. These defects may include:   - Aneurysm  - Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)    Hemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin). Very high blood pressure may cause blood vessels to burst, leading to hemorrhagic stroke.   An ischemic stroke can develop bleeding and become a hemorrhagic stroke.  High blood pressure is the main risk factor for strokes. Other major risk factors are:  - Irregular heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation  - Diabetes  - Family history of stroke  - High cholesterol  - Increasing age, especially after age 55  - Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of a stroke)        Watch this video about:   Hypertension - overview     Stroke risk is also higher in:   - People who have heart disease or poor blood flow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries  - People who have unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking, a high-fat diet, and lack of exercise  - Women who take birth control pills (especially those who smoke and are older than 35)  - Women who are pregnant have an increased risk while pregnant  - Women who take hormone replacement therapy</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q172-S2-A1" pairid="464">Meesmann corneal dystrophy is an eye disease that affects the cornea, which is the clear front covering of the eye. This condition is characterized by the formation of tiny round cysts in the outermost layer of the cornea, called the corneal epithelium. This part of the cornea acts as a barrier to help prevent foreign materials, such as dust and bacteria, from entering the eye.  In people with Meesmann corneal dystrophy, cysts can appear as early as the first year of life. They usually affect both eyes and increase in number over time. The cysts usually do not cause any symptoms until late adolescence or adulthood, when they start to break open (rupture) on the surface of the cornea and cause irritation. The resulting symptoms typically include increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), twitching of the eyelids (blepharospasm), increased tear production, the sensation of having a foreign object in the eye, and an inability to tolerate wearing contact lenses. Some affected individuals also have temporary episodes of blurred vision.</ANSWER>

You can also get pneumonia by inhaling a liquid or chemical. People most at risk are older than 65 or younger than 2 years of age, or already have health problems.    Symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe. See your doctor promptly if you       - Have a high fever    - Have shaking chills    - Have a cough with phlegm that doesn&apos;t improve or gets worse    - Develop shortness of breath with normal daily activities    - Have chest pain when you breathe or cough    - Feel suddenly worse after a cold or the flu       Your doctor will use your medical history, a physical exam, and lab tests to diagnose pneumonia. Treatment depends on what kind you have. If bacteria are the cause, antibiotics should help. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it.    Preventing pneumonia is always better than treating it. Vaccines are available to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia and the flu. Other preventive measures include washing your hands frequently and not smoking.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q174-S1-A2" pairid="467">Pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) is an infection in one or both of the lungs. Many germs—such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi—can cause pneumonia.                  The infection inflames your lungs&apos; air sacs, which are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye). The air sacs may fill up with fluid or pus, causing symptoms such as a cough with phlegm (a slimy substance), fever, chills, and trouble breathing.                  Overview                  Pneumonia and its symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Many factors affect how serious pneumonia is, such as the type of germ causing the infection and your age and overall health.                  Pneumonia tends to be more serious for:                  Infants and young children.                  Older adults (people 65 years or older).                  People who have other health problems, such as heart failure, diabetes, or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).                  People who have weak immune systems as a result of diseases or other factors. Examples of these diseases and factors include HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy (a treatment for cancer), and an organ transplant or blood and marrow stem cell transplant.                  Outlook                  Pneumonia is common in the United States. Treatment for pneumonia depends on its cause, how severe your symptoms are, and your age and overall health. Many people can be treated at home, often with oral antibiotics.                  Children usually start to feel better in 1 to 2 days. For adults, it usually takes 2 to 3 days. Anyone who has worsening symptoms should see a doctor.                  People who have severe symptoms or underlying health problems may need treatment in a hospital. It may take 3 weeks or more before they can go back to their normal routines.                  Fatigue (tiredness) from pneumonia can last for a month or more.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q174-S2-A1" pairid="468">Treatment for pneumonia depends on the type of pneumonia you have and how severe it is. Most people who have community-acquired pneumonia—the most common type of pneumonia—are treated at home.                  The goals of treatment are to cure the infection and prevent complications.                  General Treatment                  If you have pneumonia, follow your treatment plan, take all medicines as prescribed, and get ongoing medical care. Ask your doctor when you should schedule followup care. Your doctor may want you to have a chest x ray to make sure the pneumonia is gone.                  Although you may start feeling better after a few days or weeks, fatigue (tiredness) can persist for up to a month or more. People who are treated in the hospital may need at least 3 weeks before they can go back to their normal routines.                  Bacterial Pneumonia                  Bacterial pneumonia is treated with medicines called antibiotics. You should take antibiotics as your doctor prescribes. You may start to feel better before you finish the medicine, but you should continue taking it as prescribed. If you stop too soon, the pneumonia may come back.                  Most people begin to improve after 1 to 3 days of antibiotic treatment. This means that they should feel better and have fewer symptoms, such as cough and fever.                  Viral Pneumonia                  Antibiotics don&apos;t work when the cause of pneumonia is a virus. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it.                  Viral pneumonia usually improves in 1 to 3 weeks.                  Treating Severe Symptoms                  You may need to be treated in a hospital if:                  Your symptoms are severe                  You&apos;re at risk for complications because of other health problems                  If the level of oxygen in your bloodstream is low, you may receive oxygen therapy.

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q175-S1-A1" pairid="470">Most low back pain can be treated without surgery. Treatment involves using over-the-counter pain relievers to reduce discomfort and anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce inflammation. The goal of treatment is to restore proper function and strength to the back, and prevent recurrence of the injury. Medications are often used to treat acute and chronic low back pain. Effective pain relief may involve a combination of prescription drugs and over-the-counter remedies. Although the use of cold and hot compresses has never been scientifically proven to quickly resolve low back injury, compresses may help reduce pain and inflammation and allow greater mobility for some individuals. Bed rest is recommended for only 1–2 days at most. Individuals should resume activities as soon as possible. Exercise may be the most effective way to speed recovery from low back pain and help strengthen back and abdominal muscles. In the most serious cases, when the condition does not respond to other therapies, surgery may relieve pain caused by back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries.</ANSWER>

			</ANNOTATIONS>
			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q177-S1-A1" pairid="472">How well a person does after a stroke depends on:  - The type of stroke  - How much brain tissue is damaged  - What body functions have been affected  - How quickly treatment is given    Problems moving, thinking, and talking often improve in the weeks to months after a stroke.  Many people who have had a stroke will keep improving in the months or years after their stroke.   Over half of people who have a stroke are able to function and live at home. Others are not able to care for themselves.  If treatment with clot-busting drugs is successful, the symptoms of a stroke may go away. However, patients often do not get to the hospital soon enough to receive these drugs, or they can&apos;t take these drugs because of a health condition.  People who have a stroke from a blood clot (ischemic stroke) have a better chance of surviving than those who have a stroke from bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke).  The risk for a second stroke is highest during the weeks or months after the first stroke. The risk begins to decrease after this period.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q177-S1-A2" pairid="473">Although stroke is a disease of the brain, it can affect the entire body. A common disability that results from stroke is complete paralysis on one side of the body, called hemiplegia. A related disability that is not as debilitating as paralysis is one-sided weakness or hemiparesis. Stroke may cause problems with thinking, awareness, attention, learning, judgment, and memory. Stroke survivors often have problems understanding or forming speech. A stroke can lead to emotional problems. Stroke patients may have difficulty controlling their emotions or may express inappropriate emotions. Many stroke patients experience depression. Stroke survivors may also have numbness or strange sensations. The pain is often worse in the hands and feet and is made worse by movement and temperature changes, especially cold temperatures.                  Recurrent stroke is frequent; about 25 percent of people who recover from their first stroke will have another stroke within 5 years.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q180-S1-A1" pairid="478">Vitiligo is a skin condition in which there is a loss of brown color (pigment) from areas of skin, resulting in irregular white patches that feel like normal skin.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q180-S1-A2" pairid="479">Summary       Vitiligo causes white patches on your skin. It can also affect your eyes, mouth, and nose. It occurs when the cells that give your skin its color are destroyed. No one knows what destroys them. It is more common in people with autoimmune diseases, and it might run in families. It usually starts before age 40.     The white patches are more common where your skin is exposed to the sun. In some cases, the patches spread. Vitiligo can cause your hair to gray early. If you have dark skin, you may lose color inside your mouth.     Using sunscreen will help protect your skin, and cosmetics can cover up the patches. Treatments for vitiligo include medicines, light therapy, and surgery. Not every treatment is right for everyone. Many have side effects. Some take a long time. Some do not always work.     NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q180-S1-A3" pairid="480">Vitiligo is a condition that causes patchy loss of skin coloring (pigmentation). The average age of onset of vitiligo is in the mid-twenties, but it can appear at any age. It tends to progress over time, with larger areas of the skin losing pigment. Some people with vitiligo also have patches of pigment loss affecting the hair on their scalp or body.  Researchers have identified several forms of vitiligo. Generalized vitiligo (also called nonsegmental vitiligo), which is the most common form, involves loss of pigment (depigmentation) in patches of skin all over the body. Depigmentation typically occurs on the face, neck, and scalp, and around body openings such as the mouth and genitals. Sometimes pigment is lost in mucous membranes, such as the lips. Loss of pigmentation is also frequently seen in areas that tend to experience rubbing, impact, or other trauma, such as the hands, arms, and places where bones are close to the skin surface (bony prominences). Another form called segmental vitiligo is associated with smaller patches of depigmented skin that appear on one side of the body in a limited area; this occurs in about 10 percent of affected individuals.  Vitiligo is generally considered to be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body&apos;s own tissues and organs. In people with vitiligo the immune system appears to attack the pigment cells (melanocytes) in the skin. About 15 to 25 percent of people with vitiligo are also affected by at least one other autoimmune disorder, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, pernicious anemia, Addison disease, or systemic lupus erythematosus.  In the absence of other autoimmune conditions, vitiligo does not affect general health or physical functioning. However, concerns about appearance and ethnic identity are significant issues for many affected individuals.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q181-S1-A1" pairid="481">Pregabalin comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food two or three times a day. Take pregabalin at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.    Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of pregabalin and may gradually increase your dose during the first week of treatment.    Take pregabalin exactly as directed. Pregabalin may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.    Pregabalin may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. It may take several weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of pregabalin. Continue to take pregabalin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking pregabalin without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking pregabalin, you may experience withdrawal symptoms, including trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, or seizures. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually over at least one week.    Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with pregabalin and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</ANSWER>

Azithromycin has the chemical name (2R,3S,4R,5R,8R,10R,11R,12S,13S,14R)-13-[(2,6-dideoxy-3-C-methyl-3-O-methyl-α-L-ribohexopyranosyl) oxy]-2-ethyl-3,4,10-trihydroxy-3,5,6,8,10,12,14-heptamethyl-11-[[3,4,6-trideoxy-3- (dimethylamino)-β-D-xylo-hexopyranosyl]oxy]-1-oxa-6-azacyclopentadecan-15-one. Azithromycin is derived from erythromycin; however, it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring. Its molecular formula is C38H72N2O12, and its molecular weight is 749.00.    Azithromycin has the following structural formula:    Azithromycin, as the monohydrate, is a white crystalline powder with a molecular formula of C38H72N2O12•H2O and a molecular weight of 767.0.    Each tablet for oral administration contains azithromycin monohydrate equivalent to either 250 mg or 500 mg azithromycin. In addition each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, polyethylene glycol, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, partially pregelantinized starch, sodium citrate, sodium lauryl sulfate, titanium dioxide and FD&amp;C Blue No. 2 (500 mg only).</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q186-S1-A1" pairid="486">Lightheadedness occurs when your brain does not get enough blood. This may occur if:  - You have a sudden drop in blood pressure.  - Your body does not have enough water (is dehydrated) because of vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and other conditions.  - You get up too quickly after sitting or lying down (this is more common in older people).    Lightheadedness may also occur if you have the flu, low blood sugar, a cold, or allergies.  More serious conditions that can lead to light-headedness include:  - Heart problems, such as a heart attack or abnormal heart beat  - Stroke  - Bleeding inside the body  - Shock (extreme drop in blood pressure)    If any of these serious disorders are present, you will usually also have symptoms like chest pain, a feeling of a racing heart, loss of speech, change in vision, or other symptoms.  Vertigo may be due to:  - Benign positional vertigo, a spinning feeling that occurs when you move your head  - Labyrinthitis, a viral infection of the inner ear that usually follows a cold or flu  - Meniere&apos;s disease, a common inner ear problem    Other causes of lightheadedness or vertigo may include:  - Use of certain medicines  - Stroke  - Multiple sclerosis  - Seizures  - Brain tumor  - Bleeding in the brain</ANSWER>

Over-the-counter medicines such as loperamide (Imodium) and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol and Kaopectate) may help stop diarrhea in adults. However, people with bloody diarrhea—a sign of bacterial or parasitic infection—should not use these medicines. If diarrhea is caused by bacteria or parasites, over-the-counter medicines may prolong the problem, so doctors usually prescribe antibiotics instead.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q192-S1-A1" pairid="493">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets and other antibacterial drugs, Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.  Urinary Tract Infections: For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.  Acute Otitis Media: For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of BACTRIM in pediatric patients under two years of age. BACTRIM is not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.  Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults: For the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when a physician deems that BACTRIM could offer some advantage over the use of a single antimicrobial agent.  Shigellosis: For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei when antibacterial therapy is indicated.  Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia: For the treatment of documented Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and for prophylaxis against P. jiroveci pneumonia in individuals who are immunosuppressed and considered to be at an increased risk of developing P. jiroveci pneumonia.

				<ANSWER answerid="Q193-S1-A1" pairid="494">Lidocaine comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is applied only once a day as needed for pain. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use lidocaine patches exactly as directed.  Your doctor will tell you how many lidocaine patches you may use at one time and the length of time you may wear the patches. Never apply more than three patches at one time, and never wear patches for more than 12 hours per day. Using too many patches or leaving patches on for too long may cause serious side effects. To apply the patches, follow these steps:      Look at the skin that you plan to cover with a lidocaine patch. If the skin is broken or blistered, do not apply a patch to that area.     Use scissors to remove the outer seal from the package. Then pull apart the zipper seal.     Remove up to three patches from the package and press the zipper seal tightly together. The remaining patches may dry out if the zipper seal is not tightly closed.     Cut patch(es) to the size and shape that will cover your most painful area.     Peel the transparent liner off the back of the patch(es).     Press the patch(es) firmly onto your skin. If you are applying a patch to your face, be careful not to let it touch your eyes. If you do get lidocaine in your eye, wash it with plenty of water or saline solution.     Wash your hands after handling lidocaine patches.     Do not reuse lidocaine patches. After you are finished using a patch, remove it and dispose of it out of reach of children and pets. Used patches contain enough medication to seriously harm a child or pet. </ANSWER>

The efficacy of bupropion in the treatment of a major depressive episode was established in two 4-week controlled trials of depressed inpatients and in one 6-week controlled trial of depressed outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the Major Depression category of the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).  A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies the presence of 1) depressed mood or 2) loss of interest or pleasure; in addition, at least 5 of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning: depressed mood, markedly diminished interest or pleasure in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.  The efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets USP (SR) in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 44 weeks following 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

				<ANSWER answerid="Q194-S2-A1" pairid="496">The information included under the Incidence in Controlled Trials subsection of ADVERSE REACTIONS is based primarily on data from controlled clinical trials with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (SR). Information on additional adverse events associated with the extended-release formulation of bupropion in smoking cessation trials, as well as the immediate-release formulation of bupropion, is included in a separate section (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Other Events Observed During the Clinical Development and Postmarketing Experience of Bupropion).  Incidence in Controlled Trials with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (SR)  Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Among Patients Treated with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (SR)  In placebo-controlled clinical trials, 9% and 11% of patients treated with 300 mg/day and 400 mg/day, respectively, of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) and 4% of patients treated with placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The specific adverse events in these trials that led to discontinuation in at least 1% of patients treated with either 300 mg/day or 400 mg/day of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) and at a rate at least twice the placebo rate are listed in Table 4.  Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More Among Patients Treated with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (SR)  Table 5 enumerates treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred among patients treated with 300 mg/day and 400 mg/day of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) and with placebo in placebo-controlled trials. Events that occurred in either the 300-mg/day or 400-mg/day group at an incidence of 1% or more and were more frequent than in the placebo group are included. Reported adverse events were classified using a COSTART-based Dictionary.  Accurate estimates of the incidence of adverse events associated with the use of any drug are difficult to obtain. Estimates are influenced by drug dose, detection technique, setting, physician judgments, etc. The figures cited cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. These incidence figures also cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products as each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions.  Finally, it is important to emphasize that the tabulation does not reflect the relative severity and/or clinical importance of the events. A better perspective on the serious adverse events associated with the use of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) is provided in the WARNINGSand PRECAUTIONSsections.  Incidence of Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Controlled Clinical Trials  Adverse events from Table 5 occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) and at a rate at least twice the placebo rate are listed below for the 300-mg/day and 400-mg/day dose groups.  Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (SR) 300 mg/day: Anorexia, dry mouth, rash, sweating, tinnitus and tremor.  Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (SR) 400 mg/day: Abdominal pain, agitation, anxiety, dizziness, dry mouth, insomnia, myalgia, nausea, palpitation, pharyngitis, sweating, tinnitus and urinary frequency.  Other Events Observed During the Clinical Development and Postmarketing Experience of Bupropion  In addition to the adverse events noted above, the following events have been reported in clinical trials and postmarketing experience with the extended-release (SR) formulation of bupropion in depressed patients and in nondepressed smokers, as well as in clinical trials and postmarketing clinical experience with the immediate-release formulation of bupropion.  Adverse events for which frequencies are provided below occurred in clinical trials with the extended-release formulation of bupropion (SR). The frequencies represent the proportion of patients who experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event on at least one occasion in placebo-controlled studies for depression (n = 987) or smoking cessation (n = 1,013) or patients who experienced an adverse event requiring discontinuation of treatment in an open-label surveillance study with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) (n = 3,100). All treatment-emergent adverse events are included except those listed in Tables 2 through 5, those events listed in other safety-related sections, those adverse events subsumed under COSTART terms that are either overly general or excessively specific so as to be uninformative, those events not reasonably associated with the use of the drug and those events that were not serious and occurred in fewer than 2 patients. Events of major clinical importance are described in the WARNINGSand PRECAUTIONSsections of the labeling.  Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions of frequency: Frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients. Infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, while rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients.  Adverse events for which frequencies are not provided occurred in clinical trials or postmarketing experience with bupropion. Only those adverse events not previously listed for extended-release bupropion (SR) are included. The extent to which these events may be associated with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) are unknown.  Body (General):Infrequent were chills, facial edema, musculoskeletal chest pain and photosensitivity. Rare was malaise. Also observed were arthralgia, myalgia and fever with rash and other symptoms suggestive of delayed hypersensitivity. These symptoms may resemble serum sickness (see PRECAUTIONS).  Cardiovascular:Infrequent were postural hypotension, stroke, tachycardia and vasodilation. Rare was syncope.

Guanfacine extended-release (long-acting) tablets (Intuniv) are used as part of a treatment program to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age) in children. Guanfacine is in a class of medications called centrally acting alpha2A-adrenergic receptor agonists. Guanfacine treats high blood pressure by decreasing heart rate and relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body. Guanfacine extended-release tablets may treat ADHD by affecting the part of the brain that controls attention and impulsivity.  High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.</ANSWER>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q196-S1-A2" pairid="499">Guanfacine is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.    Guanfacine works by controlling the nerve impulses along certain nerve pathways. As a result, it relaxes the blood vessels so that blood passes through them more easily. This helps to lower blood pressure.    Guanfacine extended-release tablets are also used alone or together with other medicines to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. It works in the treatment of ADHD by increasing attention and decreasing restlessness in children and adults who are overactive, cannot concentrate for very long, or are easily distracted and impulsive. This medicine is used as part of a total treatment program that also includes social, educational, and psychological treatment.    This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.    This product is available in the following dosage forms:        Tablet      Tablet, Extended Release</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q198-S1-A1" pairid="501">Duloxetine comes as a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of the medication by stomach acids) capsule to take by mouth. When duloxetine is used to treat depression, it is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. When duloxetine is used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, the pain of diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, or ongoing bone or muscle pain, it is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take duloxetine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take duloxetine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it, take it more often, or take it for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor.    Swallow the delayed-release capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Do not open the delayed-release capsules and mix the contents with liquids or sprinkle the contents on food.    Your doctor may start you on a low dose of medication and increase your dose after one week.    Duloxetine may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. It may take 1 to 4 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of duloxetine. Continue to take duloxetine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking duloxetine without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking duloxetine, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; anxiety; dizziness; tiredness; headache; pain, burning, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet; irritability; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; sweating; and nightmares. Tell your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms when your dose of duloxetine is decreased.</ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q200-S1-A1" pairid="503">Nephrotic syndrome is a collection of symptoms that indicate kidney damage. Nephrotic syndrome includes the following:        proteinuria—large amounts of protein in the urine      hyperlipidemia—higher than normal fat and cholesterol levels in the blood      edema, or swelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face      hypoalbuminia—low levels of albumin in the blood    Albumin is a protein that acts like a sponge, drawing extra fluid from the body into the bloodstream where it remains until removed by the kidneys. When albumin leaks into the urine, the blood loses its capacity to absorb extra fluid from the body, causing edema.    Nephrotic syndrome results from a problem with the kidneys’ filters, called glomeruli. Glomeruli are tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that remove wastes and excess fluids from the blood and send them to the bladder as urine.    As blood passes through healthy kidneys, the glomeruli filter out the waste products and allow the blood to retain cells and proteins the body needs. However, proteins from the blood, such as albumin, can leak into the urine when the glomeruli are damaged. In nephrotic syndrome, damaged glomeruli allow 3 grams or more of protein to leak into the urine when measured over a 24-hour period, which is more than 20 times the amount that healthy glomeruli allow.</ANSWER>

			<ANSWERS>
				<ANSWER answerid="Q200-S2-A1" pairid="504">Nephrotic syndrome can be caused by diseases that affect only the kidneys, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or membranous nephropathy. Diseases that affect only the kidneys are called primary causes of nephrotic syndrome. The glomeruli are usually the targets of these diseases for reasons that are not fully understood. In FSGS—the most common primary cause of nephrotic syndrome—scar tissue forms in parts of the glomeruli. In membranous nephropathy, immune molecules form harmful deposits on the glomeruli. Nephrotic syndrome can also be caused by systemic diseases, which are diseases that affect many parts of the body, such as diabetes or lupus. Systemic diseases that affect the kidneys are called secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome. More than 50 percent of nephrotic syndrome cases in adults have secondary causes, with diabetes being the most common. </ANSWER>

				<ANSWER answerid="Q200-S3-A1" pairid="505">Treating nephrotic syndrome includes addressing the underlying cause as well as taking steps to reduce high blood pressure, edema, high cholesterol, and the risks of infection. Treatment usually includes medications and changes in diet.    Medications that lower blood pressure can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease causing nephrotic syndrome. Two types of blood pressure lowering medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease by reducing the pressure inside the glomeruli and thereby reducing proteinuria. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a diuretic—a medication that aids the kidneys in removing fluid from the blood—can also be useful in helping to reduce blood pressure as well as edema. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications may also be needed.    Statin medications may be given to lower cholesterol.    People with nephrotic syndrome should receive the pneumococcal vaccine, which helps protect against a bacterium that commonly causes infection, and yearly flu shots.    Blood thinning medications are usually only given to people with nephrotic syndrome who develop a blood clot; these medications are not used as a preventive measure.    Nephrotic syndrome may go away once the underlying cause has been treated. More information about treating the underlying causes of nephrotic syndrome is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Glomerular Diseases.</ANSWER>
