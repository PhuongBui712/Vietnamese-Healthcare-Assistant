# Vietnamese-Healthcare-Assistant

## Instruction

This project aims to develop a Vietnamese-language healthcare assistant powered by a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). The LLM will be trained to provide comprehensive support for users seeking information and guidance on both physical and mental health concerns, tailored specifically to the Vietnamese context. This project seeks to bridge the gap in accessible healthcare resources for Vietnamese speakers by offering a user-friendly and culturally sensitive platform.
